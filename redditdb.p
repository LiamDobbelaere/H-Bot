VI am 31 years old Japanese Hikikomori(roughly 5 years). Sorry for my bad English in advance. \u000a\u000aThis morning I found my mother was dead in bathtub. She was taking bath at 2am, while I was eating curry rice she made. So, I instantly knew she was dead when I found her this morning.\u000a\u000aI loved her so much. I was planning to gift a tablet this month once I got income from Affiliate marketing.  I get around $300 per month. I was trying to increase income and She was always helpful. I hoped maybe I could stay with her another 20 years or so. I know it is very strange that someone want to stay with mother at age of 30s.\u000a\u000aEven though I was jobless man. She was never mad at me or asked me go out or find job. Our life was rough. My older brother committed suicide when I was a student. After that, I stopped smiling, I couldn't work daily. I know she was trying to make me happy.\u000a\u000aI am not afraid of going outside. Today I went to a supermarket to buy food for relatives. \u000a\u000aI do not have any friends or I was not even trying to make. I threw away my cellphone at age of 25 because I was once suicidal. But I have never tried to commit suicide but cleaned up all stuff.\u000a\u000aI do not have father but I have older sisters and grandmother. I regret so much not caring about my mother while she was alive.\u000aI could call an ambulance when she was asking for drinks last night. That would had saved her life. She was sick at the time on her bed. \u000a\u000aI am not sure I am going to be happier or have strong will to get over this . I am not sure what to do or what i want to do in my life. My mother was so much to me.

VIt's sadly true. In my case I'm extremely damaged goods. BPD, Severe anxiety/depression and suicidal obsession... pretty much the works. \u000a\u000aA gun is the most effective therapy for me. I often fantasize jumping from a bridge but I feel like that is played out. Not only that, it disturbs others peoples days. I rather be forgotten not be "that crazy jackass who held traffic for 4 hours". I don't want to bother other people's lives. I just want mine over with so I can make it a better place. A world without a pathetic excuse of a person wasting the planet's resources. \u000a\u000aIt's funny how much my life has changed over 5 years.. I'd never get excited about seeing a car speeding down the street.. I get so excited now to the point where I get in a running stance to jump right in front of it at times. Obviously this would lead to mental issues for the driver potentially as well as on lookers.  \u000a\u000aI can see how the Japanese suicide forest is so popular. In a forest a body can disappear without people knowing. My hope is that I can do the deed without disturbing anyone or make anyone worry about my corpse. Maybe people would wonder where I went and hope I was doing good. It would be a pleasant way to go right? \u000a\u000aFor the people who will try to say "life is worth it" it isnt. At least not for me.\u000a\u000aI'm terrible all around.  Incredibly stupid, extremely useless and better off dead. "Everyone is replacable" according to my first two jobs. They're right. At least when it came to me.\u000a \u000aMy family will stop mourning my death after a week. Hell my mother, two aunts and my grandmother told me to go ahead and do it.  \u000a\u000aFriends? Haha haven't had any of those for like 3 years. People are interested in me but that's because I don't say much. I already know they'll eventually hate me like the rest of the world does...\u000a\u000aThe sad part is that this is all fixable but I don't have the time or money. Premiums and co pays would rip the little amount of money I have saved up and the free mental care in my city is atrocious. Being forced to move out in 2 months doesn't exactly help either.\u000a\u000aI don't want pity or nice messages how everything will work out alright. It won't. Nothing ever does for me.\u000a\u000aFor the people who read this far I really hope you continue pushing on. Fight your struggles and demons and be the amazing people you are. You guys all deserve a chance at great lives. You aren't beyond help. For those who are on here to help others thank you for being so kind. Don't let others get to the point of no return..\u000a\u000a\u000a

VExisting is painful, at this rate. I want to die, but I can't kill myself. I just can't. Whether it's because I love my family too much to do it to them or I'm just chicken, I don't know. But I'm done. My parents love me so much, but they don't understand. My father is short-tempered, and my mother is too fixated on my brother's depression (and he truly needs help) to bother with me. She just doesn't know that my anxiety has gotten this bad, and my dad can't understand it.\u000aI'm a piece of shit. I just want to die, right here, right now. I want to die of a brain aneurysm, cancer, kidney failure, anything.\u000aAs long as I don't have to go through with this life.\u000aI'm now contemplating suicide. It feels like there are two layers to my feelings. The top layer changes, sometimes happy, sometimes sad. But the bottom layer is perpetually angry, perpetually depressed, perpetually tired. Life seems so blurry now, and every day seems vaguer and vaguer.\u000aI'm so tired of this life. I just want to move on.

VI'm so sick of this shit. I'd rather be dead. I know I shouldn't kill myself because I have a niece and a boyfriend that I care deeply about, and my parents would be upset, but if it weren't for them, I'd be out of here in a heartbeat. My anxiety and depression are crippling. I want to cut myself again but I can't because my boyfriend would see and become upset.\u000aBefore anyone tells me to, yes I've already sought help, but it doesn't seem to do much. I don't really know what I'm trying to get out of posting this. Just venting I guess.

VI'm sorry I wasn't a good enough sister I'm sorry I wasn't a good enough daughter. I'm sorry I couldn't be a mother in time. I'm sorry I pushed you to cheat on me. I begged for months, I screamed for months.. I bled, I braved, I conquered. \u000a\u000aThis is my final goodbye and attempt,  a few more days to get things in order. \u000a\u000aThere's nothing left for me here. \u000a\u000aPlease donate all my things to the children hospitals. I'm sorry daddy. \u000a\u000aTo the people that used to matter. When you find this, don't be angry or afraid please. I loved you all but I was worthless.\u000a\u000aDaddy. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I wasn't strong enough to beat the demons inside my head.. They've been there for as long as I can remember. They hunt, they growl, they tear my head apart every waking hour. It's a fright train in the dark. I tried I tried so hard to survive throughout the years, I tried to be a good daughter, I tried to make you proud of me. All I did was become a burden. All I did was scream all the signs to a world that remained deaf. I just wanted peace. I just wanted it to stop so badly.. I just wanted to disappear. I tried to reach out daddy. I tried so hard, I screamed, begged, pleaded.. The world chose to remain deaf.. The family.. Friends chose to remain deaf. I thought I could win.. I thought one day I'd be able to conquer them, to finally sleep at night.. To breathe without an ache in my chest.. It wasn't your fault and it won't ever be, please know that. Know that I loved you dearly, know that I was proud to have you be my dad.\u000a\u000aTo the oldest brother. I'm sorry I was always difficult. I never meant to be, but I had voices inside that tore everything apart, I loved you the most. I was safe, you we're my home and my security, you we're my safe place inside a world of hell, you kept me warm and made me laugh when I wanted to die. Every sleepless night I cried, every silent scream.. I was thankful for you. Always. Stay brave and strong. You we're my hero and the best brother anyone could ask for. \u000a\u000aTo my sister. I resented you for such a long time, I wanted your life, free of secrets, a beautiful daughter, friends.. You protected me every time things got really bad.. You read to me and held me when I had nightmares. You we're the bravest person I knew when I was little, where did she go? Where did you go?. I couldn't reach you anymore. I couldn't tell you the truth anymore.. But I still loved you, you taught me how to ride my bike and roller blade, you taught me I didn't need to be a girl that slept around or wore revealing outfits to get attention. You we're strong. \u000a\u000aTo my brother. You made me laugh when I wanted to die, you we're the only one who never hated me or thought I was difficult.. You'd sit up with me all night just to make sure I was okay, you've always been my second favourite. You're not a bad person. Ever. You're just a little lost and that's okay, some people never find their way home.. You're stronger than you think.. But this isn't the life I wanted for you. You can accomplish so many things if you just got rid of the toxic people in life.. If you took a breath instead of exploded. I want that life for you, I want you to have a house, a warm bed at night. I want you to be happy. So promise me you'll try okay? Promise you'll do that for me. \u000a\u000aTo my first love. My heart hurts, my breath doesn't work, you are and we're the light of my life.. You we're the first person I ever fully trusted.. I knew you were trouble then but God how I loved you, your smile, the way you'd look at me like I was priceless, the way my body fit against yours, safe and sound.. The way you'd intertwine with me when you we're asleep, as if you were afraid id disappear right then and there. Your heart beat was my home, your arms were my armour. You made me such a better person in the end, you taught me what it was to be happy, to love, to smile and mean it. I know we weren't perfect but you were my sun and i was the moon, we couldn't exist without one another. You're my first love and my only love, you had my soul, body, heart in your hands. You never once looked at me and saw a crime scene. You touched me like I was made of glass, you used to love me so much it made you feel sick sometimes. I'm happy. I got a chance to love you, to meet you, to be apart of your life, your family and the doggy. You showed me what it was to be human for the first time.. I love you with every inch of my being, i forgave you even though the thought of another woman..the cheating nearly ripped me to shreds, i couldn't stand it.. I guess i still cant but i don't hate you for it, i loved you too much, I hoped our daughter would of had your eyes..your smarts..i hoped she'd be just like you.. I'm sorry I took her away. People will be angry at you the most but don't let them win, you weren't to blame.. I just loved you too much.\u000a\u000aTo my best friend. I love you unconditionally..so much it makes my heart hurt.. I know you'll be a devastated the most and I'm so sorry i failed.. I'm so sorry I'm about to leave you alone in the dark..you were my light and my saviour my whole life, you were my voice..you were my confidence, you were my annoying soul mate. You were my favourite person and i'll always love you, always. You were never a burden to me. Never. You're extraordinary and my only true friend.

VI'm undeveloped. I'm empty. I have sever ADD and have been zoning out my whole life. Socially I have always been passive and some times opinionated. As a child I had few friends and went through periods with none. This wasn't because kids excluded me, people often try to talk to me but there is nothing here to share.\u000a\u000a I don't feel I ever developed and identity. I haven't been present enough to create experiences with any depth. When any thing is difficult my mind withdraws and zones out i keep trying to bring it back but life doesnt have any continuity sliping in and out of consciousness. As a result all I've learned in life is in bits and peices. \u000a\u000a I also know I'm depressed i have been anxious and depressed since 3rd grade I'm 20 now. I also know what it would take to change. Sometimes i have bursts of optomism and imagine the ideal journey of recover I'll undergo and the life I'll create. It's a dellusion though. All the qualities it would take to change I've never developed; perseverance, metacognition, self awarness, self motivation, comunication, self expression.\u000a\u000a I know what it would take to change I've been going to therapy for 6 months and have been reading about ADD. I've been trying to follow a schedule I meditate, eat healthy and lightly excercise but it all seems so pointless alone. It's also not that much and I don't think I'm capable of maintaining a job or frienship, I struggle to even communicate with my therapist. Sometimes I think I make up problems and act emotional in therapy because I don't really know what I think in the moment.\u000a\u000a I'm going to try stimulant medication for the first time in a week. I've tried ssri's one worked for the depressiona for 4 years but exacerbated the ADD and made be even less self aware. I had fun and friends but I was making a complete ass of myself and going no where. Ive tried ADD non stims strattera made me more depressed and I'm on intuniv it isn't doing much for me. If stims don't significantly help me I'm going to out myself I've been driving around with a note and noose in my glove box for weeks. I'm so tired of my life I hardly have the patience to wait to try the meds first. \u000a\u000aSorry this is so long I just started reading this thread yesterday and felt understood reading others posts and comments. \u000a\u000aYou can ask me anything or share your life experiences. You can give advice if you feel compeled to but the problem isn't me not knowing what to do, so it's not all that helpful.

VMy friends know my reddit username and creep it regularly but I don't do throwaways. Shit, I'm hoping they see this. I'm seeking attention. This is my cry for help. I can't say these words to you so read them here. These are my daily thoughts. This is what goes through my mind as I lie here in bed.\u000a\u000aI set a date for my suicide. I put it in my calendar - exactly one year from now. March 5th, 2018. What's the significance of that day? Absolutely nothing. When that notification pops up on my calendar next year I'll have to make a decision. Do I extend it to another year? Has my life improved since I set this up? If not, you know the drill. To be honest, I'm not sure I'll even make it that long but whatever. It gives me peace of mind.\u000a\u000aI'm completely fucked up mentally no matter how hard I try to hide it. I don't give a shit about anything in my life anymore. My grades are dropping but I can't be bothered to care anymore. I have no desire to succeed in my studies nor do I still have passion for the material. I started drinking again even though I'm low on money. I actually have an intense desire to be self destructive and fuck up my life. No drive to do anything else. My life is a checklist of chores until I can go back to sleep. I'm not even worried about how people would react to my suicide. Fuck them, I'm tired of feeling like this.\u000a\u000aI'm lonelier than I've ever been in my life, yet I'm surrounded by people. I'm nobody's best friend. I'm too quiet, too nice, too boring. I'm just there to support the friend circle. Nobody wants to talk to me one on one but if everyone's meeting up then sure, include me. Probably a good thing because I get anxiety talking to anyone like that anyway. I have a huge desire to be social and develop relationships but I'm too scared, unskilled, and uninteresting. It's like I'm cursed. There's only one person I feel comfortable talking to one on one and she lives in another fucking country. She probably thinks I'm boring too because I would. Yeah I dragged you into this, sorry. You're the closest friend I have, isn't that sad? You always ask why I'm forever alone, well this is why. \u000a\u000aI could write so much more but this post is getting huge so I'll stop here. There you have it friends and strangers.\u000a\u000aI fucking hate myself.\u000a

Now, I am bitter, resentful, and I find his pleas to keep my miserable self alive not only selfish, but pathetic. I'm breaking up with him today, cause I can't live like this, and this is unhealthy and unfair towards him. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIt's not just him, though - my family too. My loved ones. And I get it, death of a loved one is hard and naturally wants to be avoided. But I can't DO THIS ANYMORE, and I feel like I'm being forced to.\u000a\u000a\u000aWhy are people so fucking selfish? \u000aThey cut your lifeline, but then beg you to stay. \u000aIt's cruel.\u000a\u000a\u000aSorry for the rant, I am just exhausted. \u000a\u000aTLDR: I want to die, but people keep begging me to live, and I am beginning to resent/hate them for it.\u000a\u000aEDIT: Forgot TLDR, minor grammar edits.\u000a\u000a

VI am a 17 female, and I am the most positive person you'll ever meet in your life! Atleast, that's what the people who know me say. But if you ask me, I'm the most negative human being I know, but only when it comes to myself.\u000a\u000aAll of close friends are either depressed and suicidal or suffering through other mental illnesses such as OCD, anorexia etc. I have to admit that I probably attract them because I have a desperate need inside of me to help people in what I can't help with myself. And I know it sounds terrible, but I  just wanted to help people because I understand how it feels. Also, it's nice to have friends that can truly understand what you're going through.\u000a\u000aHowever, I've noticed with this problem is that I can't fully express how I feel most of the time to my closest friends because I am so scared of triggering them. How can I tell my friends why I want to kill myself without making them accidentally think of the same. How can I tell my friend I just purged without triggering her to do the same? How can I ever be negative and sad to my friends and not have my mood rub off on them? I guess that's why I try so hard to be positive because I just want my positivity to shine onto them and make their days a lil bit brighter, but I feel like I have to endure the darkness all by myself.\u000a\u000aA quote describes this very well,\u000a"I can't talk about the rabbit hole without accidentally inviting you down it" - Blythe Baird "relapse"

VMy anxiety and depression has completely ruined my life. My family members either hate me or died years ago. I've hurt my friends so much that none of them want anything to do with me anymore. I'm no longer going to school. I don't know what to do. It's all fallen apart and even if I do 'get better' I'll still have nothing because I've lost everything I've ever cared about. My best friend turned against me. My other best friend? Oh, she hates me. My other other best friend? He's probably more depressed than I am. And that's it. The people who I care about. None of them are here for me now. I stand alone. I have nothing, nobody. I have no future, I have no hope, I have no reason to continue living. I have been robbed of everything. And the worst thing is, I fucking deserve it.\u000a\u000aTomorrow morning I'm going to get on a train to get far away from here so nobody will find me. I'm going to buy some rope. I'm going to get a taxi to a rural location. Then I'm going to find some secluded woodland with a tree with a branch high enough and strong enough. Then I'm going to hang myself.\u000a\u000aThis isn't another cry for help. This isn't me screaming into the abyss, hoping someone gives me a reason to live. This is my note. This is what people will have to remember me by, this is what people will have to look at when they try and work out why I did it. Here's the answer: I did it because I destroyed every positive thing in my life. And, just a warning, there's no coming back from that. Nobody should ever make these mistakes again. Nobody should have to feel this pain again. It isn't fair.

VI'm in my mid 30's. I have a JD from law school (never took the bar due to money issues) and an MBA and literally no professional experience to speak of. I've worked, but only at part time jobs that never really had anything to do with my educational background. \u000a\u000aI've spent my life running from one "easy" answer to another. Now that I've run out of student loan money, I can't really find refuge in school again. \u000a\u000aNo one will hire me. I don't know if it's my lack of experience or just the job market, but I feel unemployable. I'm living hand to mouth, and more and more the world feels like it just wasn't meant for me. My passions have always been based in creativity, but you just can't make a living off of creativity easily.\u000a\u000aThe closer I get to homelessness, the more the pressure to kill myself grows. It feels like waves of pressure pushing against my chest that grows by the day. The only reason I want to stay alive at all is superficial and grows weaker as the pressure grows stronger. (I love the Marvel movies and they're about the only thing I look forward to anymore.)\u000a\u000aA few weeks back, my step father offered me a gun for protection (since I was going to try Uber driving to try to make ends meet). I turned him down because I knew that if I took that gun, it'd basically be signing my death warrant.

VI don't know what to do anymore. I've officially lost everything. I almost crashed my car on the way home from his house. It was a weird feeling, like something I can't describe. Although it wouldn't have been on purpose, the thought of knowing I might die or at least get seriously injured felt... nice in a way. Like I'm finally going to be free from all of this pain. Or at least have physical pain to distract from the mental pain and heartache I'm feeling right now.  \u000a\u000aI can barely think straight.  \u000a\u000aI'm just so tired. So fucking tired.  \u000a\u000aI just want to sleep. Forever.  \u000a\u000aI wish I had crashed my car. I really, really do. I know it's such a shitty way to think but right now... that's all I want.

VI feel like I just need help getting to tomorrow. I'm not looking for some long-term solution, but I want to figure out how to will myself to wake up in the morning. Suicidal thoughts used to be few and far between, and talking myself out of it wasn't much of a problem. It's gotten to a point where it consumes my mind every night, and I don't know how much more I can take before I just give up. I'm tired of fighting. I'm tired of making excuses to stay alive even though I'm miserable. Dying sounds like one of the most peaceful options.

VI think I literally just destroyed what was left of my family. I'm literally shaking and crying. Yes, I'm going to be a 20 year old guy soon and I cry all the time. I'm pathetic. I don't even know if anything I'm saying is going to make sense.\u000a\u000aI've been depressed/suicidal my whole life. I let myself go in every way imaginable since I figured worst case I would just kill myself. I stopped caring about school, stopped trying to put on weight, didn't care about my health, stopped caring about my social life, etc.\u000a\u000aTwo years ago I realized something had to change, I couldn't keep living the way I was. I came to the conclusion that I either would kill myself on the spot or make a significant effort to improve my life. At the time I chose the latter and I think I regret it now.\u000a\u000aWhat's so sad is I feel like I was making significant progress in improving myself to the point where I could maybe become a normal human being in the near future. I started Uni with a really good GPA and wanted to go to grad school. I was even thinking I might be almost good enough to try and get a girlfriend at one point. My friend even think I'm gay because I've never had a girlfriend. Like I said, I'm pathetic.\u000a\u000aI just had to fuck it all up.\u000a\u000aI barely ever talked to my parents for most of my life so I figured I would just finish university and move out peacefully without causing any issues. Nope, I'm now reminded why I'm a complete failure at everything I do.\u000a\u000aI just had a small disagreement with my father a couple of hours ago and I FUCKED it up. I usually just avoid conflicts and try to not argue with him but whatever, it started to get a little heated so I told him that he has issues (I'm convinced he's really does have issues). He started slamming doors and yelled at me. I then told him how I really felt about him. I told him that I didn't love him and that I never wanted to have to see him again. fuck fuck fuck\u000a\u000aI know my sister/mom don't really love him either. The dispute with my father ended with him telling me he has no place on this planet and wants to kill himself. I know he's been suicidal in the past but god dammit. I don't love him but I fell like I just put the last straw that broke the camel's back. If he kills himself it's my god damn fault. If I never said anything everything would have been fine. I don't even know if I care if he dies or not to be honest. I don't think I have any options left. I can't become a normal human being. I'm so useless.\u000a\u000aWhat in the world is wrong with me? Why did I have to say anything? I should have just killed myself a long time ago.\u000a\u000aWhy am I even posting here.\u000a\u000aFUCK\u000a

VShe cheated on me 10 months ago. 6 weeks before our wedding. She has since claimed it was because of my job problems at the time and has made me feel like shit. She made some other outrageous claims but those have been forgotten and ignored. \u000a\u000aShe has continued to keep me on a hook. when things get rough she comes to me for support. She has cheated on her new boyfriend with me multiple times. All the while I'm trying to convince her we should see a counsoler.\u000a\u000aI know she's toxic and bad for me. But I love her more than anything. I've moved to a new city 800 miles away from her. I have no friends here. I got a great job but I can't get her out of my head.\u000a\u000aI know she has done horrible things to me. But I can't help believing she's still the one. I don't know how to date. I'm 27 and she was my first real girlfriend. I don't know how to meet people.\u000a\u000aI'm lost. I'm lonely. I miss my best friend. She was the world to me. I've been here for a month and not a single day goes by that I don't think of crashing my car or jumping off a bridge.\u000a\u000aI can't do it though. my little brother 18, had a friend kill himself 2 years ago and I can't do it to him again.

I live with her. whatever I do there's always something I fuck up when I just want to make her happy. she's been through so much and I love her but there is no pleasing her. \u000a\u000aand of course I'll never be a man because of the set of genitals I was born with. and no one will ever see me as one. \u000a\u000abut life's fine. things are a ok and I still have an urge all the time late at night to just end it.\u000a\u000aat this point my mother thinks I'm doing this for attention because of how often I get to this point. but it's real. I have great friends and a huge support network but nothing helps and this feeling will always plague me.

VI'm having pretty strong suicidal thoughts and I wish I could talk to someone about it without them looking at me like I'm crazy. \u000a\u000aI feel like I've got literally nobody in my life who supports me completely. My friends have stopped talking to me and one even outright said that I'm annoying. Then there's my family, I came out as gay to them a year ago and they're just pretending I never did. Even when I bring it up they say I'm messed up in the head just because of who I'm attracted to.\u000aPart of the problem of why I've got no friends anymore is because I have social anxiety. I feel like I'll never have a meaningful connection with any other human, I'm just too awkward and different. I don't even know if anyone will miss me if I'm gone.\u000a\u000aSorry for my rambling, I've never really been good at organizing my thoughts

VThe last 12 months have been shit. I've been to hospital for physical Illness, I don't find joy in any part of my life, my girlfriend of 5 years left me because she couldn't handle my garbage personality, I've been diagnosed with Bipolar2 which is basically a big sign on my forehead which says 'do not love this person, they are too much effort', My roommate killed herself (most likely because my depressive bullshit got to her), leaving me to pay her side of the rent and I've been fucked working my boring job for money that gets siphoned directly into this house that is only a reminder of how fucking alone I am right now. \u000a\u000aI know everyone says that the pain will fade and I'll build myself back up from this but honestly it hurts too much and I have no idea how to get better. I'm seeing therapist after therapist and nothing is improving. I just want to fucking die, everything is too hard. I have nothing to live for and I spend each and every night crying. There is no hope on the horizon and I want to die SO FUCKING BAD

VHi SW, I was diagnosed with depression several years ago. I take my pills regularly and seek help whenever I feel the "black dog" is near me. I've been able to keep the depression under control with the help of my friends, family, and psychologist. I was able to get my life back on track. I had been free from suicidal thoughts for 1 year, until very recently. Title says it all. It's incredible how a few shitty days almost completely reverted my recovery process. I feel like I'm back in square one. I am tired of trying, and receiving nothing but shit from the world.\u000a\u000aEdit: I forgot to mention that not a single person defended me. I was left there alone, receiving looks of pity or scorn. I felt abandoned and that was enough to sink in horrific despair.

VI don't know what to do anymore. I've Been stressed out for so long, my anxiety keeps consuming me, then depression also sinks in. \u000a\u000aMy parents don't see anything is wrong. They put the pressure on me still to be what they want me to be even though I'm an adult. And I am so used to being that, if I think anything but what they would want me to think I feel terrible inside. Their voices are always there telling me that I can't do this or that. They make me paranoid due to things like cameras, I don't know why but even before I knew they were watching I FELT them watching. I can't be "normal" because they enforce rules on me. I know I am a disappointment to them but I'm not sure why. I don't do much wrong. I try so hard too. Like why is it that I'm not good enough..? I feel like all of this is in my head too, and I ask if it's real to those around and they agree that they aren't right towards me but I still doubt myself...\u000a\u000aI should be graduating this year from college but instead I'm still stuck not understanding what I want to do with my life. I'm in classes that I can't stand. And due to that and then being too hard I'm failing. I look at a test and I can't even get one problem right...I feel dumb. I'm so stressed out so in class it's hard for me to even focus.\u000a\u000aI am so stressed about money. I owe my mom money, which I told her I wouldn't pay until she gives me MY grant money. But that didn't go well, they said they would shut my phone off. They said they would shut my phone off because I spend money on shampoo too.... I owe on taxes (somehow) because my parents are claiming me. Yet I am trying to save up money. Everything in my house is so money oriented it freaks me out.\u000a\u000aI love my boyfriend and I know he loves me but we keep arguing and it's worrying me. Like I try to explain what's going on and it's like we never get the time to talk or this or that. Or he thinks it's a simple solution. We push aside so much for others too. Our relationship is never first at all. It's so frustrating. Like he hurts my feelings too and it's like he gets mad at me it feels when I get upset about things. I just don't feel like anyone wants me half the time. \u000a\u000aMy "friends" are hardly ever here for me. They pick and choose when they want to be here, and turn like it's no ones business. I wonder why I even call them friends still. Then I have other friends (only a few) that I know care but I feel like I annoy them too much. \u000a\u000aI look around me and see all this stuff I need to get done but I can't, I don't have the motivation anymore. I can't come home and relax because I come home to notes of what I have to do plastered around from my mom. \u000a\u000aWork is stressful too because I am affected by all this other stuff and my brain can't focus. I am doing okay at work but I lack the motivation to go. My coworkers are so fake to me and it just makes me feel worse. \u000a\u000aThen I look in the mirror and have no clue who I am. I feel like a child inside (possibly due to my parents) but I look older. I get so overwhelmed when I realize that I am an adult sometimes as well. Just because it's like real. I can't separate what's me from what my parents want me to be and how they view me.\u000a\u000aMy health isn't the best and I think it is due to all this stress. I feel like I can't trust anyone except my boyfriend, but I feel like he is too busy to be here. And I feel like a burden if I talk to him about this too much. I keep getting headache, light headed, tummy issues, tension, nauseous, fatigued. I can't even sleep well at nights any more and then in the morning I have to get up early for school or work. I can't even get a day to relax. I feel like I am going insane.\u000a\u000aI keep getting bouts of anxiety. And bouts of tears and sadness. But days like today, I feel numb. I don't feel anything. And that in itself pushes me to these thoughts. Thoughts I won't ever act on, but thoughts none the less. I feel like o don't deserve anything in my life, and like those around me would be better without me. They wouldn't have to worry about faking being my friend. They would have to worry about arguments. Then I wouldn't have to worry that I am not enough. My brain just spins and spins and won't stop with all this, and I can't even wrap my mind around it. That's the worst part. I just feel like I'm drowning in this and I am too afraid to get out of it.

VI don't know what to do anymore, every day it becomes more and more evident that I am a pathetic excuse of a man, ugly facial features and skin and overweight. No hobbies no talents and no time. I spend over 24 hrs a week commuting too and from my 7-3 job and that gives me alot of time to just think, think about ways of killing myself. And you know the saddest fucking part, I know I am trying to manipulate people through my sorrow trying to make people give me attention and atleast pretend to care, but nobody does. I haven't even had a hug from another human in atleast a year, my support network is thin and I am too scared to open up properly to them as they might view me as a pussy. I am thinking I am going to electrocute myself in my bathroom tonight, one knife in the active and another in the neutral then flick the switch and after a brief amount of pain it will finally be over.

VI didn't excel in school, I got by doing the bare minimum. When I went to college I smoked and partied and played Xbox.  When I dropped out of college a year later I went to community college and wasted a semester and a half doing poorly and not going to class.   Then I dropped out and got a shit part time job and found a girlfriend.   First girlfriend ever and I asked her to marry me after 6 months.  \u000a\u000aFast forward 11 years I have no friends.  A dead bedroom marriage, no hobbies, and I'm out of shape.

I want to do it now, but something is holding me back.\u000a\u000aI thought I'd be over her after a month, but that came and I was as miserable as the day she changed her mind. 100 days came and I was still miserable. Five months passed, and I lost all my sanity. She claimed to be my friend but she showed me nothing of the sort. I put my trust in her and she told me that things were fine but she did nothing but lie and drag me along. Leaving me lost with nothing but my imagination. And I lost my sanity. I became obsessed because I couldn't understand how someone could lie to my face and put me through that torture.\u000a\u000aEven now I'm 8 months away from when I first lost all joy and nothing is getting better. I WILL NOT LIVE A LIFE FILLED WITH NOTHING BUT THIS PAIN AND DARKNESS.

VI'm a senior in high school, I know knowing about the world, but I just don't get why you'd kill yourself over being single. \u000a\u000aEarlier  I had a panic attack and almost, *almost* tried to kill myself because I couldn't properly draw a chair. My grandmother had always called he artistic, and I couldn't draw, and I shut down. Which is not a good reason to kill myself. I'm so judgmental, it's disgusting.\u000a\u000aI can always talk myself out of it but I don't even want to. I have no inspiration to do the things I love or even do my school work any more. I'm going to fail my senior project class, and that means I won't graduate. And if I don't graduate, I'm going to kill myself. I've had fantasies about killing myself in the principal's office, so she's the one that sees... but that's bad. That's mean, even if I don't like her, she doesn't need that. But where? I don't want my family to see my body... \u000a\u000aI want to be a teacher, but I don't see how I could be with thoughts like these.  I don't know what I'll do with my life if teaching doesn't work out. \u000a\u000aI don't know what else to say. This is a really nice community, because suicidal people help other suicidal people. If you want, you can lie to me, and break the rules, and tell me it's going to be okay. Reddit bullies people out of tumblr by threatening the sjws (which i always considered myself one...) and there aren't really sunny, happy quotes on here. I miss them. Are there subreddits for that?

I can't do anything right. I fucking hate myself so much. I fuck everything up. I will never find the woman of my dreams. I'm so pathetic for wanting to kill myself over women. I've never been with a woman before. I've never been with someone that I love. I'm still a virgin. People say I'm attractive but I don't see it. I have tried and tried again but Im always getting rejected. It's getting to a point where Im just gonna give up now. I'm 21 but I don't see myself being successful with anything. The girl that I liked lied to me telling me she couldn't do a relationship right now  but when I view her snapchat story she's always with this guy. I'm so fucking jealous. Why can't that be me?

People don't understand how much it means to me to settle down with someone that I truly enjoy being with. I wish I wasn't like this but people have always picked on me for not being able to get a girlfriend ever since middle school and it's stuck with me. Yeah maybe I'm fucked in the head and there's no changing that. I want to prove people wrong, that I can find the woman of my dreams. What the fuck is wrong with me? Why can't people see me as the nice guy I am? I'm honest, nice, charismatic, caring, attractive(?), willing. That's what people tell me at least.

I can't be fixed and sure as hell no women will want me for who I am.  I'm sorry everyone. I've been trying for 21 years but I'm calling it a quits. Sorry for the sloppy writing but frankly I could care less. I'll be on the road by the time you finish reading this, thinking about whether or not if I should do it.\u000a\u000a

VI've been with a man for a few months now. I know its short but I have fallen in love with him. I'm \u000a31 and he's 42. We've had a great few months together and we've had great bonding and everything. I fell in love. He told me he loved me too. I've even invested so much in this I was thinking of proposing to him. Last night he told me his family thinks he should try to get back with the mother of his two young children (2 and 5 years old). So I said well I hope you'll stay with me and not go back to her (he always said how 'crazy' she was and hated her and regretted having children with her) and he explained to me that his kids come first he doesn't want to be with her but being with me would be hard enough because his baby momma is crazy and if she knew he was living with me she would probably freak out and not let him see his kids. \u000aI asked him "So what are we even doing?!" And he said we're hanging out while life is letting us. Idk I see it as if we broke up. Am I crazy. Idk what to think. How should I react to this?

VEverything is going downhill. I'm 18, and what's most likely bipolar with psychotic features. It's the only medicine out of several that I've responded to, but I think my doctors are afraid to diagnose me. They've openly mentioned it makes the most sense, which is also backed up by the medicine working. Anyways, I've been dealing with this since I was about 8. I had suicidal thought, and even threatened to slit my throat when I was 8. Since then, it's very hard for me to pay attention, have a stable mood, make decisions, keep my thoughts in order (my post may change topics a lot), save money, and essentially everything someone my age should be able to manage to a certain extent. I'm a burden to my family with my medical costs of my doctors and medicines that total to around $1000 a month when it was it's worst. Almost exactly a year ago, I lost my best friend. It really showed me how fragile life is, and it devastated me for months. After 8ish months, I learned to live with it. It actually probably taught me to live and love life. I met the love of my life 10 months ago, 2 months after my friend's passing. They've supported me so much, but it's been going downhill. They were always there for me, and held my hand through the worst of it, but I fuck it up. I don't know why I'm still in our relationship because it can be extremely unhealthy for both of us at times (more often than I'd like to admit), and I'm to blame for 90% of it. It's because I've always had abandonment issues on both sides of my parents, and I can't trust anyone fully. I always think she's hiding something, but maybe I'm just paranoid. School is going downhill, and my grades are dropping. I'm losing contact with my friends both because I want to, and because I feel like if I don't, I'll just hurt them. My family relationships are shit. I'm very estranged and isolated, and I can barely talk to my own mom, or my sister. My sister was always my best friend and guardian, but I'm pushing her away very fast. I can't stop it. I have terrible anxiety, and I've almost been admitted to a hospital because of self harm and psychosis. I know this is a long post, but I need to get this off of my chest. I think I've made up my mind finally to just end it. I hate how it has to come to this, but I want the pain to end. I can't handle it, and I see no hope for my future. I'm just bored of life, and when I'm not, I'm in pain. It's hard when you go to people bawling your eyes out while saying this, and only the ones you pay seem to care. Since I was 8, I always imagine myself dying due to suicide. I feel my life has just been me waiting for something to change, and as soon as it does, it gets ripped out of my hands and burnt in a fire I started and could've prevented. I can't do anything right, and to those reading this, you're probably feeling more emotions towards me than my own family is if I were to say this. I know people have worse lives than I've had, but they're much more strong than I am. I just can't keep going, and I hate to feel like I have to be another statistic. I know I'm going to cause pain to everyone I know, but they didn't care when I needed them the most in my life. They're just superficial, and only care about themselves. Just typing this seems to be lifting weight off of me, because a stranger is still reading it to this point, and seems to care. I just want at least one person to hear me, and hopefully hear my story as to why I feel this way. I feel like I'm about to go through psychosis again, so I feel when I emotionally detach from reality is when my hallucinations and delusions will finally take over and end my suffering. The storm is coming, and I don't know if I can do anything to help it from hitting me very hard. I don't want pity or up votes. I just want someone to read this, and maybe empathize with me. It's hard to resist. I feel weak. I'm just ready to end the pain

VI had an altercation with my mother about my grades.\u000a\u000a\u000a"I want to see what you got on the midterms."\u000a\u000a\u000aI haven't told her the truth, that I am failing every single college class. Stopped going to class for weeks and sealed my fate when I decided to not go for my midterms. I skipped. I just couldn't do it. There's a lot of zeros but that was my choice: to not save myself. Can't trust myself to do the right thing. Professors been emailing me to drop the classes. \u000a\u000a\u000aI am already on academic probation from last semester. The same scenario playing out, depression winning the game--except I failed one class and barely passed the other in the last semester. Now I'm failing them all. This is worse, much worse. \u000a\u000a\u000aI pretty much gave up, except for making the step to see the psychologist on campus two weeks ago. I had thoughts of suicide before and called the suicide hotline late at night when I was walking down the streets, super homeless. The homeless part? Left my keys at parents' home and survived 2 weeks without going into my dorm. Really bad time, I'm walking down the street because I can't sleep and was thinking of suicide. So I had someone physically meet me at 2 in the morning, in the middle of some street on campus. Police was there too, because duh, it's 2 am and maybe I'm a violent person. Far enough. So they made me sign papers, agreement to see a psychologist on campus at a certain time or they get involved.\u000a\u000a\u000aOkay, so I started to see my psychologist. Now I have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder. The sessions don't help because I just talk to him for an hour, but there's so much of a mess in my life that I don't share all the details. He gleams over the particular things that causes me stress, focusing only on the past. Dude, I need to change the present and future, forget about my shitty childhood. I'm at wits end, and decided to take my life. \u000a\u000a\u000aThis was just the last straw.\u000a\u000a\u000aI wouldn't show my mom the grades so I walked out with my purse and left in a short dress in the middle of the cold night. And I walked for 20 minutes, deciding whether to hit CVS or Publix. I decided Publix because the Aspirin--my drug of choice, has a prettier looking bottle.\u000a\u000aSo when I got there, I grabbed my bottle of Aspirin and a bottle of ICE to make it go down easier. Then, freezing in the cold, I sat on the bench outside and started to pop the pills, watching the people go to their cars. I counted the pills and read the label thoroughly.  1st pill, drink. 2nd pill, drink. I remembered from a class that Aspirin has a high LD50 for a low dosage compared to other drugs. At that moment, that was when I decided if I were to suicide, it would be Aspirin. Two years prior, I made that choice to use that drug as my partner in crime. 3rd pill, drink. 4th pill, drink. Only x more pills to go to die from a bleeding stomach and a shot liver and kidney. 5th pill, drink. I down the 5th pill and think, I'm 1/3 of the way done.\u000a\u000a\u000aI was going to down my 6th pill, so I put it in my palm. And I dropped the pill. I just couldn't do it. I'm a coward for not completing my mission, perhaps, but at that moment, I realized that I really don't want to die. I just want my problems to disappear, running away from my problems.\u000a\u000a\u000aInstead of going to class, eating food, and keeping up with friends: I just stayed in bed and slept. And slept. And slept. I also was recently dumped and the guy was my first? So the bed became more enticing. My roommate hates me. Sleep and sleep. My roommate brings guests over while I'm sleeping and has alcohol? I get drunk and sleep and sleep. My friends don't want to see me again? Sleep and sleep. My Dad asking me for my agenda? Sleep and sleep.\u000a\u000a\u000a----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u000a\u000aNow I have to tell my mother the truth. Tomorrow, the whole thing. That I'm going to drop out of college for being really stupid. Best case scenario: I withdraw and then come back next spring with ruined financial aid, no scholarships, and everything out of their pocket. No, I can't do that to them. Or tonight I can finish adding those 9 pills, already having 5 pills in my system, and drift away forever in peace. I really hate myself and how childish I am, everything is about me me, because this really doesn't seem that bad from another's point of view. But this was my first suicide attempt and I might as well document it. And I'm still thinking about it, even though I don't want to die unless I am pushed to the limits.\u000a\u000aThank you for reading this drivel and apologies for the poor organization, not really much of a writer.

VI planned it for two days not too long from now. I know I will hurt many people but my selfish ass doesn't have to deal with their hurt anymore. I want to go for the second date because it is right after a certain deadline a bunch of my friends have to deal with as well, so that this does not affect their academic career too much. It is also a bank holiday so there will be fewer people around in my student town to witness. (I don't have access to any methods without witnesses that I'm certain will be successful) The second date I planned is just in case I cannot deal with the stress of that big deadline. As much as I want to just give up on classes and everything that comes with it, I don't want to worry anybody and realize what's going on with me before it happens. \u000a\u000aYesterday I was discussing my vague "future" plans (I've never wanted a future, ever) with my mother and she said it would be a shame if I gave up on academia and got a job below my capacities.

I can't really explain it, but I always felt that if I didn't have my freedom and carve a path for myself, I was basically a failure and unworthy of self-respect. I wanted to be an inventor, game developer, artist, musician, filmmaker, author...anything that would allow me to be somebody.\u000a\u000aI thought I'd found a way to get there when I discovered direct marketing and set out to teach myself enough to start a small agency and become a consultant. My laziness and anxiety killed that plan and I ended up drifting from one plan to the next, none really appealing to me.\u000a\u000aSince I can't sustain myself otherwise, I'm pretty much forced to take a job, which I know is an objectively reasonable decision, but it still feels like giving up to me.

VI don't know what I expect to happen by posting here, but I thought I'd at least give it a shot since I have no one else to say this to. For the past 3 years, I've been severely depressed. I like to believe it's for a combination of 3 things that cause it: I'm not good at anything, I have no friends, and I have no girlfriend or any chance at love. My main focus for most of my life has been to find something that I'm good at and enjoy. The main problem I have with this though is that I have a bit of a learning disability. It takes me much longer (if at all) to aquire skills that should be easy for most. Recently, I tried to get back into competitive Super Smash Bros Melee (which I've played on and off for the past 2 years), only to fail to improve at all once again. Also recently, my friends left me because of my depression. I was hoping I could make friends through Melee, but it seems people only care about you if you're good at the game. It's gotten to the point where I no longer care about trying to stay alive. I'm not actively trying to kill myself, but I've certainly stopped making choices that would prolong my life. I want to magically turn my life around, but I don't see that ever happening. I just thought I'd post this here, I don't think anyone can help me at this point though.

VI don't think I've ever been happy. I'm only 20 but I already feel like I've wasted my life. I'm fat, ugly, freakishly tall, have ADHD and clinical depression, and I don't know what to do. I feel like being in a romantic relationship might make me happy but that's never going to happen because I believe physical attraction is pretty important in a relationship but I couldn't really expect anyone I'm attracted to to be attracted to me. I've thought a lot about killing myself over the past few weeks, more than I have in the past and a lot more seriously. I have a therapist and while I usually feel better after my appointments, that feeling is very short lived. I've thought about admitting myself to a mental hospital but I don't know if that's a good idea. I really don't know what to do with my life. Nothing interests me. I feel like I'm destined to kill myself and I'm just biding my time until it happens because I'm a worthless piece of shit.\u000a\u000aWhat the fuck can I do? I need help but what's the fucking point when there are some things I can't change. I fucking hate that I was born. I didn't ask for this. I feel extremely isolated and out of touch with reality.

VHello (wish i would've went with the name Kissedby1000Diamonds but whatev's).\u000a\u000aI'm just gonna go straight into it -- i'm a MTF transgender, 26, pre-op. I believe in reincarnation. I hate being transgender but i don't want to identify with being a male. I feel like killing myself time and time again. I have thoughts of harming myself. I eat junk food out of pure craving.\u000a\u000aI'm hoping my life is very short -- which is inconvenient because i was hoping to live longer as a post-op than pre-op. I still don't feel like living a long life. I feel trapped because i'm afraid of there being some serious consequences for those who kill themselves. Most religions or reincarnation believers who don't follow any religion (like myself) seem to stand by that belief.\u000a\u000aMore than i want to finish my transition in this life, I just really want to be born a girl and be female from birth to death, identify as female, and live longer than in this life.\u000a\u000aAdditionally, i lost the first 20+ years being someone i'm not. I'll never know what exactly i would be thinking and feeling if i were born female but i know now that i hope in my next life, i'll remember how badly i wanted to be a female so i can take better care of myself and actually want to sustain my life rather than have it end prematurely.\u000a\u000aAlmost everywhere else i seemed to turn about this seem to have rules about suicide, etc. so my posts either get heavily edited or deleted. When i joined this site, i looked at the rules and saw nothing about posts about suicide so fuck it. I just wanted to get my feelings out and ask if i kill myself is there any possible way i can reincarnate and be a girl?

VLong story short im in a country where i have no friends or family. The only person i knew here (spouse) threw me away like i was nothing. I need to kill myself tonight. I was gonna use the carbon monoxide method with a grill and charcoal in my car or bathroom but i couldnt fucking find a small grill today that was less than $100 dollars. So i am thinking about hanging myself. I tested it out earlier with a short suspension hanging and it was so painful. \u000a\u000aIf i take sleeping pills before i hang myself will it be less painful? Or will i just take longer to die? \u000a\u000aIf i take 2400 mg diphenhydramine hydrochloride and 8000mg acetaminophen will I die? Will it be slow or will i just sleep? Im guessing i would die of liver failure and it would be terrible. Or i fall asleep and choke on my own vomit, is that possible? \u000a\u000aIf this doesnt work considering i live in a large city, i may jump off a tall building. \u000a\u000aI would really prefer the CO method, is there any other ways to die of carbon monoxide? I have an old car but i know it has a catalytic converter that im pretty sure has gone bad just happened a few weeks ago but still i dont know how effective it would be (i dont have a garage) so i would have to connect some sort of pipe to the exhaust and put it in  the window and seal it\u000a\u000aBut how long would i take to die? \u000aI have already made up my mind about dying please just answer my questions. \u000a

I don't want to come across as selfish or ungrateful at all. My family mean an awful lot to me and I'm very conscious that I will be hurting them.

VI'm sitting here in bed cutting away at myself listening to my roommates have sex. I don't wish that was me but I think I just want to be loved. I have no family anymore.. When my grandparents both died a few months ago, my entire family decided it was time to stop caring for any other family other than their own immediate family. Mine just decided to drop me as well and I can no longer contact them as they moved and changed numbers. I don't have any friends to talk to. The closet thing to a friend I talk to is my shirt hanging on the wall. I call him Warren. I've tried to kill myself at least 3 times since I was young but was stopped by the feeling of fear. Everytime it came to it I always asked myself: is the short pain worth the eternal silence? I always answered yes but yet I was too scared to feel that pain. I had watched too many people kill themselves on the internet as a kid and thought that might of desensitized me to it but it just grew my fear even more. The silence I want so bad is at my fingertips and I'm to chicken to follow through. There isn't anything or anyone holding me back but me. Now I work at a job I hate, I come home to a place I'm hated and can't move from here due to a lease, and I have no outlet for my emotions. I can't focus on a hobby long enough before it eats at me I'm just trying to escape what I can't fight.. I try to eat my problems away but I just cry on my food and throw it out.. I can't sleep more than an hour even if I get blackout drunk. The fact I'm working at all is actually still getting to me. I just called my boss and quit because I don't know why I'm working in the first place.... I'm wasting away and I won't let myself stop. I tried calling one of the help lines on another thread but got a answering machine hahaha best laugh I've had in years. I don't know what to do anymore.. I feel like I could keep writing until my phone screen is too dirty to continue. But it would just beba repeat of whatever I've said. How do I get out of this loop? Why won't I accept short term pain for long term gain? Why why why... Am I still here? What good do I do humanity being alive? By being an example of failure? To be the comparison for someone else to see that they got it pretty good? Am I just the low bar to everyone around me? Why can't I let myself go.. I'm not doing anyone any good and I'm certainly not worth the trouble of anyone's time. I chose my time to go and I can't accept it. Please tell me why.. I don't know anymore. I just don't know anymore

VI'm a 20 year old male who goes to community college and lives with his parents. In a couple of days, I turn 21.\u000a\u000aFor the past year, I have been regularly suffering from anxiety and panic attacks. This is partly due to my personality, and partly due to where we live (it is a pretty miserable place). I have applied to transfer to a university, but I'm worried that my family doesn't have enough money to send me there, and I can't apply for financial aid. I can work, and I do a little bit right now, but college is still fucking expensive.\u000a\u000aI already feel miserable enough that I'm a year behind in college due to my anxiety attacks, and now I just feel like a drain on my family. I am my parents hope and dream, and I feel like I am consistently letting them down. They have so much hope for me, always telling me how smart I am, how much potential I have, and I just can't stand the fact that I am a shut-in loser. \u000a\u000aIt's not just my parents. Everyone in my life thinks I'm way smarter than I actually am. Maybe I have it in me, but so far, my life has not been getting better. I really want to live a happy life, but it is just not possible in this situation. I'm scared as hell to tell my parents that I don't want to go to college at this moment. Whenever I ask how we will pay for it, they always say "we'll find a way," something that does not alleviate the anxiety, especially when I know their financial situation. \u000a\u000aI am also still a virgin, which makes me feel like shit because I just have no real interest in sex, but I still feel like I should lose it anyway. I know girls who are attracted to me, but I'm too fucking shy to even bring up the topic. \u000a\u000aAnxiety is the bane of my existence. I just wish I could go through life without that constant feeling. I wish I never needed to take xanax, prozac, or buspar. I just want to live life like everyone else, and every passing day makes me feel more and more like a failure. I already feel like the disappointment of the family, and I know that if I keep going the way I am, I actually will be.\u000a\u000aI don't really know what the point is of this post anymore, I just needed to vent. Suicide is starting to look a lot more attractive nowadays, but there are a lot of things I want to do before I finally off myself, but they all feel out of reach. I'm sorry for any grammatical errors, or for coming off as whiny.

VHi. I'm a recent Law school graduate whose just starting out professionally. I'm planning on taking the bar soon, and entering the military. However I've been considering suicide for the past two years. Despite my relative successes in life, I've grappled with depression for most of my adolescent and adult life (26). I've dated but have never had a serious relationship. I have difficulties maintaining longterm romantic relationships, chiefly because of the depression and it's manifestations. My family doesn't really know the extent of my problems, and I don't plan on telling them. If / when I go, I'd like it to be that they know it wasn't their fault, just my own short comings. I was raised Catholic, but have lost faith, chiefly because I don't have much in myself to begin with. If God exists, he's a very distant entity, far removed from where my heart and mind are currently. I'm sort of in limbo, currently living at home while preparing for the Bar...or ending my life.i I'd like to think I have something to live for, but really I can't see myself escaping the emptiness that's dominated my life for so long. There isn't much about life that seems worth holding on to. I fantasize about being a normal functioning male adult. Those fantasies are fairly mundane, and serve as a surrogate for the life I've failed to have all these years. Its a coping mechanism, but has lost its effectiveness. There's only so much you can pretend while real life breaks the illusion. So I'm now considering exit options. I have a 9mm handgun, but im afraid I'll botch the attempt and just end up maiming myself. My other option is drowning myself, probably at Lake Lanier or Lake Oconee, near where I live. I could also go to downtown Atlanta, and jump off one of the many high rises. I'm getting closer to gathering the courage to do it, but I guess, like most people, I'm still reticent.

VI've been having a really tough time lately. I know that everyone has issues, many many have far more than me. Even though I consciously understand this, I can't help but feel as though my life is awful. \u000a\u000aWhere to even start.. For as long as I can remember I've had depression.  Alcoholism came next as a means to numb myself to not only emotional issues but also the physical. A couple of long term relationships (2+ years) ended because of this, and I absolutely know it was my fault. Depression was a huge part of it back when it all began, but sexual issues caused me to feel like I needed to drink so I could last longer. \u000a\u000aI ended up drinking preemptivly, hoping she'd want to have sex, but half the time I'd just end up being a drunk asshole that my girl would want nothing to do with. Consequently, I think that really helped me become an alcoholic. In the beginning I didn't even want to drink, I felt it was almost necessary if I wanted to please her. Holy fuck, this is awkward and I'm sorry.\u000a\u000aThree quarters of the time I wasn't even interested in drinking, I just sort of felt it was necessary.  The times I'd drank I was the best sex of her life and the times I didn't she'd try to tell me it was okay, and not to make a big deal out of things. Whether or not she was being truthful, I don't know completely. I just know that I felt inadequate as a man.\u000a\u000aMy shitty behavior just sort of escalated at that point and I ended up as a full fledged alcoholic. It was the ultimatum I couldn't handle or fix, and it's how I lost two women that, well at least one of them, I could have seen myself spending the rest of my with.\u000a\u000aNot to humble brag but even with a shitty economic situation, I've never had a problem finding an attractive woman. That said, I've avoided anything that could possibly blossom from anything beyond friendship, with the excuse that I have too much shit I have to deal with right now.\u000a\u000aAnyways, I've thought about suicide a few times throughout my life (3 or 4 times in the first 30 years of my life), but the past 6 months or so I have found myself thinking about / planning what to do multiple times per day. The only real change that I can think of when it comes to medication is zoloft, but I've managed to lose my job and consequently my place to live because of depression.  \u000a\u000aI guess I'm just at the end of my rope and feel like I've actually hit rock bottom or I wouldn't even be typing this message. I stopped drinking for two years but I've began to start again, occasionally,  simply to numb my feelings. \u000a\u000aDon't even know where I'm going with this, maybe I'm just looking for someone who won't judge me, or maybe just someone who can tell me the best way to end things. If anyone got this far, I'm sorry for the wall of text, it does seem to make things slightly better though.

VI recently transferred schools to get a new start after fucking up my first semester in college(My uncle died and my parents kicked me out of my house bc they thought I was stealing money/power of attorney from him when in reality my cousin was 2 weeks pregnant and didn't want to tell anyone so I was just avoiding them). However, my counselor was from the University and I haven't had one since I transferred in January. There are no services at the one I go to now. I feel lower than I ever have been. I'm running money into the ground out of impulse and it's honestly scaring me. I've been self harming to the point of needing stitches and almost as suicidal as I was 6 months ago. I'm at my wit's end. The psychology services haven't called me back since the last psychiatrist appointment I had(January 31st). I feel like I can't control any impulses I have, I've had the worst mood swings, and I stopped taking my meds before Christmas without telling my psych. I just don't know what to do anymore. I feel like ending it but I don't want to let my family down and I don't want my Grandmother to have to deal with another loss, let alone my dad having to deal with two. I just don't know what to do. One day I'm euphoric, and the next I'm angry and depressed and the next I'm numb and it just repeats itself. What do I do? Do I risk losing another semester at college and jeopardizing my career? Do I just end it? Do I "ride it out"? Any choice disappoints my parents.

V\u000a\u000a\u000aI just can't get help, and it's killing me. I can't get hormones, or anything to just stop me turning more masculine. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aI have no options. I'm too anxious and suicidal to work to get money, I have no money and if I go with the NHS I'll be 19 by the time I can get treatment. By that time testosterone will of done more damage. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThere just seems to be no way out of this. All the other trans people I see are all out there, getting amazing support, getting all the medication they need and everything, and I'm here can't so shit about it, and just purely existing. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIt feels like suicide is becoming the only real option. Do I really want to continue living like this, knowing that testosterone is damaging me everyday, knowing that there are ways out of it but I can't do shit about it? I can't even be fucked with anything anymore, I just want to go to sleep and never wake-up, or just die and be reborn as female. But I can't, I'm having to live like this, a life I don't want. \u000a\u000a\u000aI'm about to be kicked out of sixth form. I tell people I'm just finding it too difficult, which is only 5% of the story. No one knows I'm suicidal and I take lethal amount of pain killers everywhere now. I've been keeping all my thoughts a secret for too long now. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aI got about 48 pills of paracetamol right now, I could take them all at any moment and be out of this soon. I've just been hiding all this for so long and I'm on the edge, it just seems like transition (which I can't) or suicide (which I can). \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aEveryone keeps saying to see a therapist, I'm just too nervous to say anything or do anything about it, I can't even see a GP to get a referral to gender identity clinic I'm that scared. What if I'm wrong, what if I too nervous, what if my GP is transphobic, what if my parents find out, it's just everything about it. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWhat the hell do I do?

Vive gotten to a point where Im not even sad anymore. I dont feel anything Im just tired, physically and mentally, and I cant get myself to get up in the morning to be awake for another day. I dont even want to die but I dont want to live either. \u000aalso, I think I might not visit suicidewatch for a while because i feel like I dont really belong on this website. it feels like I keep accidentally breaking the rules and I feel horrible for not being able to help people here without talking about the people that stay behind, making promises like ''it will get better someday'', etc. So yeah I havent been here for a long time but i dont think it helps me it just kinda makes everything worse so.. bye.

VHello. I'm at the point of my "life" that I feel that I just can't take this all anymore and that I need help. I'm eighteen and I'm from the Republic of Georgia, I recently moved elsewhere in Europe to study, but things aren't going the right way, they never do.\u000a\u000aAll my life I've been alone, never had an actual girlfriend, friends, I've never had genuine fun, the most fun I've ever had was playing video games and I can't even do that anymore since I moved for university and all I have is my phone and a broken laptop.\u000a\u000aMy problem is not only the loneliness, but I'm forgetful, - I had money given to me by my parents since I was moving and it's already been more than a month, but the thing is that the money went away so quickly that when I told about the money situation to my mother it really upset her to the point where I couldn't even talk to explain myself, it got the point that my mother hung up and I was left yet again, alone in my tiny room, just crying my fucking eyes out because I've had depression for almost four years now for many, many, many different reasons. The money situation is somewhat justified because I live pretty much alone and I had to purchase many items, but on the other hand I cannot recall where and how some sum of money went away. Now I can definitely try and live off of ramen noodles for the next three months, but the thing is that I just can't handle this as a whole thing no longer:\u000a\u000aI have insomnia, I cannot sleep before seven AM, I have these weird obsessions that if I don't do this or that one certain thing something* (* - bad) will inevitably happen. I always find myself remembering the past, the dreaded past which was full of unhappiness, but when I think about it, I can sort of reminisce which feels good, but then when I think about it deep down, I just realize how bad those times were and how bad the times right now are.\u000a\u000aI am a really outgoing person, but nothing works out with anyone, females, anyone -- just no, I am an envious person and I get irritated a lot by other people's situation, like why can I not be like that one guy who I finished High school with? That thought just dominates me all the time because I genuinely, genuinely and with all my heart hate my life, I hate everything that's got to do with my life and I honestly just can't keep going without help, I'm really fucking sad.\u000a\u000aI don't expect anyone to read this whole big thing, but if you do please help out, I typed all this out just to get it off of my chest.\u000a\u000aAlso forgot to mention, I've been contemplating suicide for the past three years, even today I was on the edge of my window just imagining the leap and briefly my death and what results it would have if I just pulled myself over the edge.\u000a\u000aThanks for reading

VI have lived a long life, especially for someone who has suffered most of it. It has been a journey so strange, so incredibly unfair that most of you will simply not believe me. But it is oke, because for the last 19 years I have learnt to accept that ones who have not seen struggle to believe. Tonight my story will end. Before I go for the first time in my life I want to be fully honest with someone and tell all the truth that has happened. This was my life:.\u000a\u000aMy story starts in a a small town called Tahiatash at the delta of Amu-Darya river in Middle Asia. I was born as a third child to a University teacher (dad) and a librarian (mom). Their marriage was unfortunate for many reasons, but mainly because my dad was a closeted homosexual. Sexual intercourse twice a year was the norm for a marriage that lasted 7 years. After divorce my dad cut us out of his life. I have never seen him after the last day at court. \u000a\u000aMy mother was struggling financially to support all three of us. After almost 3 weeks of living of on just water and bread, she collapsed and attempted suicide. As result we were taken into custody. When offerred to our dad he rejected us so we were placed in a foster care. The month I lived there was one of the brightest periods in my life. \u000a\u000aWhen I was picked up from the foster care by my mom, she was dating a guy named Kasim. Kasim  liked asking me trick questions like "what is the weather outside?" and no matter what I answered, he enjoyed accusing me of lying and then punishing me for lying. His favourite way to punish me was to lock me up in a dark small room for many hours. When I made any sound, he would pull me out of the room. Pull down my underwear and beat my buttocks with a wooden stick that he had carved the edge of in the shape of a bird head. The peak would penetrate my skin and cause bleeding. The harder I cried the harder he hit, so eventually I stopped crying. I forced myself to surpress emotions and pain, that was the only way. My mom saw this all happen and after a few months we all ran away.\u000a\u000aWithout Kasim's financial support we had no money and no house. Though my mom never admitted it. I know that she started prostituting herself to get us out of that situation. So many times I had to wait outside near hotelroom for her and different men. And a few times I heard her have sex with them even. I was so ashamed, but i couldnt blame her.\u000a\u000aMy mom's second suicide attempt. I was playing outside when I saw my mom being caried out of the building by medics. That day and night I spent outside waiting for her to come back. I felt so lost.\u000a\u000aThe accident. I was 8 and we were playing hide and seek at schoolground. All the hiding places were taken and I really wanted to win that time. So I opened a metal door of a small building went inside and hid there shortly after I accidentally touched something inside and got electrocuted. As result my clothing started burning and 47% of my skin got severely burnt. The next 40 days I spent at intensive care. It was pure hell, they ripped the wounds open every few days to clean and refresh bloodsoaken bandages. I wanted the pain to end, I wanted to die.\u000a\u000aFirst time seeing myself in the mirror after the incident. I was scared of who I have become. My face was swollen and body was deformed. I saw a yellow monster face. I was told I got infected by  hepatitis C through blood transfusion. I prayed every night to not wake up the next day. \u000a\u000a26 Surgeries. My mom promised me that surgeries will fix everything and one after another I was cut and sewed, cut and sewed for 3 years. Then the most talented plastic surgent in the town said that nothing else can be done and only in Europe I can be helped. That day my mom.made it her mission to get me to Europe. I, I have by then forgotten how I used to or was supposed to look. \u000a\u000aMy biggest surgery in Europe. Big skin transplant surgery that was promised to greatly improve my appearance, that took 3 months of suffering walking around with waterballon under the skin to stretch it, ended up almost killing me. I developed a significant infection that the doctors were struggling to beat and the skin transplant started to rot. The smell was horrible and the skingraft had to be taken off. The result was even more horrifying scar tissue. \u000a\u000aI attempted my first suicide. I cut my scars open but failed to cut deep enough to hit a big vein. I woke up my bed was covered in blood, but I was very much alive. My mom really freaked out. And I had to promis to never do it again. She promised there will be a solution found in future, that I had just to wait a bit more.\u000a\u000aTonight. I have waited 19 years. There is no solution to removing my deep keloid scars that cover 36% of my body now. I am a homosexual 27 years old virgin, that has been repulsed and ashamed of my body for close to two decades. My scars occupy my mind every day. I have been seeking cure desperately for such long time and still the cure hasnt been invented. I am tired of the pain, the rejection, feeling worthless. I thought that I could live my life alone as an asexual but my homosexual desires are too powerful. I came out to my mom 2 weeks ago and she refuses to accept me or speak to me. She regrets wasting 20 years of her life trying to save a gay son. I think that my last straw of hope was my job which I liked but I have been laid off due to reorganization. So now there is really nothing worth living for anymore. \u000a\u000aI have exhausted all my resources: I dont have love, money, family, I dont have anymore hope.

VI [20, F] am diagnosed with borderline disorder and panic disorder. My BPD is like feeling nothing at all or feeling everything at once.\u000aSo, whole my life I've been asexual - not attracted to any gender, I didn't have sex and things like that. Yesterday night (well it's today morning) I got drunk asf (which was my first decision based on my sudden impulse of 'Ayyy, I am so full of emotions! I am not bored by this idea after like 6 months of being bored!') and out of nothing I got "horny", which my male friend I was with got too. Horrible thing, we actually went and "did it", sort of, just with hands, then many touching and kissing. In the middle of the whole thing I've suddenly 'snapped back', I was sober out of nothing. And I was like "WHAT THE FUCK DUDE?!"\u000aAnd now, when I am back at my 'normal' - meaning I am not very affectionate - I am dead inside. I am so horribly embarrassed, I am so ashamed. This was not me, this was some sudden 'euphoria' mixed with alcohol. \u000aTo make it clear - I don't shame anyone for having sex and things, no, I kind of envy you you can, because I am so sex repulsed normally. \u000aWell I waited til the morning in his flat, now I am sick, I almost have a fever from this intense situation and when I came home I haven't stopped crying since. I am 20, guys, freaking 20 years old. And right now it's even harder for me because I cannot explain to my mother what happened. I am ashamed beyond possible. I seriously want to die.\u000aI cannot get it out of my head, the images are sticked there and I am panicking because I want them out, I don't want them. I seriously hit myself in the head like half hour ago, now I have a bruise. I didn't even planned to hurt myself, I was walking around the house and I've just hit myself repeatedly out of nothing. What the heck, guys. \u000aOh my god, it even seems like I can smell the same smells there were.\u000aEven tho I didn't say anything, so it wasn't his fault, I really didn't like it. I hated it. It was gross. I wanted to cry. But in that moment I couldn't stop, I felt like it was already too late. At least I stopped the real sex thing, you know, the real one, coitus or what it is I don't wanna know. \u000aI don't want a relationship with him, even tho he's ok dude, nice buddy with a sense of humour really similar to mine. But right now, I want to cut every inch of my body he has touched. To be honest, I've already cut my upper arm because I couldn't take it. I am going crazy.\u000aBut it was all my own fault. I hate myself so much right now, I feel like the only one thing that could help me is to tell my mother (I felt guilty if I don't tell her everything, which is another problem, I am going to talk about this with my therapist next appointment). But I just cannot, the shame is too strong. I am scared she would yell at me. \u000aI am going crazy! I feel like jumping out of the window. What am I supposed to do? What something's gonna happen? What if he hurt me somehow (unconsciously of course, not in purpose), and now I'll have to explain to someone - mother, the doctor. \u000aI am going to yell into the pillow until I die, ugh.\u000aIt's really mostly about that I can't stop thinking about touching a di*k, oh my god, someone get it out of my head.

VI tried to kill myself at 13, and I hurt my family. I'm now 16 and I now have to live with the fact that I ruined the ones I love. My parents got a devorce leaving my mother lonely and stressed. My sister got a depression, my brother stopped showing emotions completely and my mother didn't let me see that I hurt her, but I know I did. And that's why I can't kill myself. I can't possibly hurt her again, but I can't handle the guilt of hurting my family the reckless way I did. I don't know what to do, please help. I don't deserve to live, I have only brought pain into people's lifes. But I fucking can't show my pain to my family or friends and get help, that will only hurt them more, and I can't kill myself, that will only hurt everyone again.

Start over somewhere else. I feel like I've been sabotaged all my life over choices and mistakes. I feel like no one listens to me when I seriously need help. All I wanted was to do my part and change the world...I don't understand just when I thought I had balance it was taken away from me...why am I being punished for fighting for my needs and wants? Why am I being punished for just wanting to be happy? I can't survive like this...maybe I really AM a mistake.

VFor the past hour I\u2019ve been looking up tones of information on overdosing and the different side effects of overdosing and different types of medications and which would be least painful and have been reading tones of stories on Reddit and online about how peoples bodies reacted to ODing on different medications. I\u2019ve looked though all the medication I own and looked up which ones would be best to OD on and even asked my friend who has a lot of sleeping medication because she has insomnia which medication she has so I can see if I would be able to overdose on what she has. I\u2019m not really planning on overdosing\u2026I just want it to be an option, to know I would be able to take it whenever I felt the need to. I want to just have it there, just incase I want to OD. It\u2019s odd, I know but it makes me feel like I have a clear exit out of this world if I would ever need it. I don't know...I just am kind of obsessed with the idea of being able to overdose on something or having the option out there. I guess I like knowing what can kill me most efficiently.

VI think this is it. I officially give up. I'm a miserable excuse for a human being and I have no more hope of ever changing. I'm nothing but a loser--an ugly short obese balding small-dicked loser with gynecomastia and social anxiety and a severe speech impediment and a crap personality. I am universally rejected by the people I meet, whether for platonic or romantic purposes. I'm 23 and have never so much as kissed anyone let alone had sex and I can count the number of times I've been invited to a social gathering since I was 10 on two hands. I'm revolting both to myself and everyone I meet and I suffer the consequences on a daily basis. I'm over it. I'm over the pain and the depression. I'm over the self pity and the despair and the envy of all the guys who get to live the life I want. I'm over the cycle of getting my hopes up of anything good ever happening before getting them dashed once again when I remember I truly am a worthless human being destined for failure. Natural selection is trying its damnedest to get rid of me so why not give it a little help? I intend to kill myself tomorrow. The only reason I'm not going right now is because it's late and it's a four-hour drive to the bridge and I don't like driving at night. I can't wait for this shitty life to end and to be welcomed by an eternal unfeeling abyss.

VI'm thinking about killing myself. I've thought about it a lot over the years, but as a backup, a last resort. I've fought against it before because I was hopeful that my family would change, I would get a successful career that would fill the emptiness, therapy would work for me, or that meeting someone who liked me was 'just around the corner'. And I don't just mean a SO, I mean friends, anyone who might love me. I don't currently have depression (though I have had it), it just feels like suicide is the logical solution for a life that won't improve, and - on it's current trajectory - will only get worse. I have a problem with communication, and I work really, really hard at improving but I feel that there's just no point anymore. People don't seem to get me. When I reach out for help and say i'm struggling, the response is always 'everyone struggles'. Not like this. I don't want to 'hang in there' any more, I've done that for 35 years. It doesn't get better. There's temporary respite, or I can pretend I'm okay for work, but this feeling's always there waiting. I just want this thing in my head that stops me speaking, stops me caring about anything, stops me getting out of bed in the morning to fuck off and die and the only way I haven't yet tried is suicide. It's the only option left.

VIf you want to read something about me, [I remembered this post of mine from a couple years ago..](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2dyp3t/i_feel_so_alonewhat_is_the_point/)\u000a\u000aThings haven't gotten any better since I posted that. I sort of finished college, but to officially get my degree I have to do a second internship and I haven't had any luck finding one, let alone an actual job, for the past six months. I'll be 30 soon and I've never worked before, so you can imagine how well that's going (it's not). Last year at this time I was doing my first internship and almost went insane from the anxiety and stress. I had to pop Valium just to cope with the work and having to speak on the phone all day long, and now I can hardly find any work that doesn't involve being on the phone all day or direct patient interaction. My throat and stomach tighten and my hands shake just reading the job ads. I don't know how I'm gonna cope with working even if I can find someone who will hire me.\u000a\u000aI've moved so little this past year and a half that now I can barely stand or walk for more than a few minutes before I'm drenched in sweat and in excruciating back pain. I've always been in bad shape and I'm morbidly obese, but I was at least able to walk the half mile home from my bus stop without too much trouble...now I can't even make it to the kitchen or bathroom without ending up in pain. My teeth are rotting out and hurting most of the time because I don't take care of them (or the rest of my body for that matter) and can't afford to fix them. I have never cut but I do hurt myself daily and pick at blemishes and small wounds until they're 10+ times as large as they started and turn into lumps of scar tissue. There's big red painful wounds on my face and arms and belly and other places because I just can't stop and I hate myself. I'm ashamed of my weight and my scars and my hideousness.\u000a\u000aI'm still lonely as hell. The ex fiance that ghosted me several years ago came crawling back, and I stupidly gave him a second chance just to have him ghost me again a few months later. He also treated me to the visual of seeing him drunkenly point a thankfully unloaded gun at his head and pull the trigger, which still haunts me two years later. The timing of his reappearance (and my shit choices) ruined the chance of a relationship with my wonderful best friend, who rejected me romantically around this time a year ago. I withdrew from him and my few friends and have hardly spoken to anyone except my mother since then. I find myself in tears frequently because I'm so heartbroken and excruciatingly lonely.\u000a\u000aI don't get any enjoyment out of anything anymore. Everything hurts. Everything and everyone I ever cared about is just gone or I've pushed them away. All I wanted in life was someone to love, a few good friends, to make art and write, to see the world, to make it a better place...\u000a\u000aThe only reason I haven't killed myself yet is because I promised my mom I would help her out of the debt she incurred taking care of me and helping me through college, but I can't even do that and I'm hurting so much I can't cope anymore.\u000a\u000aI spend at least half my days thinking about dying and how to do it in the least inconvenient way for my mom and the least painful way for me and how I won't be hurting anymore.\u000a\u000aI can't do this anymore

VSo on the one hand if I go in there and I'm just honest, just real about this nagging, screaming, poisonous hole in the center of me that drives me, day in, day out, toward just obliterating myself, I might finally get some help.\u000a\u000aBut on the other hand I might also get sectioned or "invited to voluntarily admit myself to hospital" and I am **not** going to let that happen. Once that happens it's all over. I don't have any kind of family or support structure, so once I'm in the system I'm lost. Nobody is ever going to take anything I say seriously ever again.\u000a\u000aBut then if I flannel the whole thing a bit so that I *don't* get carted off to a secure ward, there's the chance that I'll just get that kind "You're wasting my time but I'm trying to be nice about it" smile. I've been trying for almost 2 years to get past my GP's determination to just keep sending me back home with leaflets. \u000a\u000aIf I get sent away with a pat on the head again I'm fucked. My GP is never going to make me a second referral. It'll be mindfulness and breathing exercises and recommendations about yoga and perhaps trying to get a bit more sleep and have I thought about taking up a stimulating hobby?\u000a\u000aI feel like there's this delicate, narrow band between honesty and lies with just enough of each which I have to balance on to get through this.\u000a\u000aAnd if I fuck it up... I'm finished. I get one shot to get this right or I'm either institutionalised or totally abandoned again. I just can't take it. I want to just climb into a hole and stay there forever. I really just want all this to be over and to stop feeling this way. I don't care about happy ending. I just want an ending.\u000a\u000aThere's nothing to be said. I'm not asking for anything. I don't have anyone to say any of this to outside of the internet and I had to say it somewhere.

VThe original plan was to end my life on the morning of the 9th of March. Ive gotten into an argument with someone who is important to me and they said they dont care about me anymore they wrote me a note last year and the note stated for me to go and kill myself. last year i tried a few times to kill myself obviously didn't work out as im still here i feel like ive let people down I know im not well ive never denied it its just when i asked for help and i tried to explain what i was thinking and feeling they said they would help me my god they even promised. I understand not everyone can fully understand what im feeling and how i believe suicide is the way to help. But to promise someone who is ill that you will help them and then you fail to comply its hurts so much more then before. Why would soneone do that? Make me think i was even worth helping and then nothing comes of it. Im so tired of being miserable and crying everyday. I have absolutely no one i can talk to that knows me about these suicidal thoughts. I dont speak to anyone anymore im completely isolated I even keep my phone off for days at a time Ive deleted all social media last year kept in no contact with anyone accept one person and after this person told me he doesn't care about me i think it was my last straw. Im still crying im just preparing the house and getting things ready for my death. Cleaning the house top to bottom painting my nails i might sound so silly but its important to me that i look okay when i die. I dont know why it just is. Isit 'normal' to accept death and even be looking forward to it? There are some rotten people in this world and i will never be able to understand how they sleep at night knowing what they have done...

VWhen I was a child, I've always wanted to be become a doctor, a surgeon, an astronomer....etc(something I admired). And by that motive, I kept working hard during elementary school and some middle school years, earning great marks in almost every subject. Until 9th grade which was the year I lost my motive, also known as my "hope" in life.\u000aBy that time, my grade point average dropped by a whopping 25% which affected me negatively.\u000aThe next year (10th grade), I started caring less about my grades & studying since it's all boring and pointless without the motive, but I didn't stop completely, I still kept working, just not as hard as I used to, mainly because problem-solving & learning new stuff still appealed to me (but I didn't think deeply about my future).\u000aAnd so, I began working harder the following year (11th grade), and my GPA improved by 5% of the original value (even though it was a small improvement, it still made me happy and kinda restored my self-esteem).\u000aBut this year.... Everything I ever cherished is no longer interesting. \u000aI suddenly realized that it's all pointless and boring.... my hobbies, my society, my dreams...etc whatever I do, I'll always stay bored. \u000aI had countless attempts at restoring my motivation and happiness, from socializing, to playing games, playing the piano, digital art, studying...etc yet nothing worked.\u000aBoredom is officially what defines me.\u000aI can't envision any future other than the one brimming with boredom and despair.\u000aI am posting this as a last resort, hoping that something might convince me to cling to this extremely boring life.

VI'm scared. \u000aPlease, listen.\u000a4 years ago, my grandmother sat next to me as I lay in a hospital bed. A woman in some nice clothes came to talk to me that night, and after an ocean of questions she told me I had hallucinations that stemmed from severe depression caused by early trauma. There was a word for it. "Schizoaffective Disorder" she said. \u000aThis didn't change anything for me. Slapping a name on the concept didn't change what I saw.\u000aPeople, with black skin like 3d shadows, missing noses and mouths and ears and hair, but they kept their eyes. Their eyes, nothing but milk white but I know they're staring directly at me.\u000aIt was the least of my worries when I was still living with my mother. Whoever she was with at the time would eventually settle with us, and it was only a matter of time before he wasn't satisfied with just my mother. I was lucky enough to avoid rape all but once, when I was about 7 years old. The bigger concern was being beaten to death. At least he was nice enough to leave my face untouched when I had to go to school. I would end up in my room at the end of the day, my guts screaming from being kicked too many times. It was then I would see them, usually, staring at me silently, watching me recover. Other times it was in the middle of the night, usually when my mom was arguing with whichever man it was. \u000aIt wasn't until I was 14 that I was taken from my mother. A domestic violence case lead to child services finding meth in my mom's bathroom, along with some burned spoons and needles.\u000aThe domestic violence part revolved around my sister. Her father, my rapist, got custody of her but that's a long story. He let Mom see her, but he didn't come back for her until about 4am the following morning. My mom wouldn't let him see her because he was very obviously out of his mind, yelling and slurring with bloodshot eyes. He was a crackhead. \u000aRiley was 6 at the time, and asked me to hide her, bless her heart. I shielded her with my body because I didn't know what else to do when he came into my room. If you have a little sister, try to imagine her in all of her innocence being dragged by her ankles down the hall because you failed to hold on tight enough, and you might be able to feel a fraction of the despair I felt that morning.\u000aShe was able to get free and run to the neighbors, and her father left when they called the police. \u000aFast forward a month or so later. My sister and I live a couple states north with our grandparents. My sister is crying as she looks at me struggling to breathe because I'm having a panic attack. Then we'll be back to the beginning of this post, where I am in the hospital bed and a woman is telling me I have a disorder and need to undergo treatment and get help.\u000a\u000aI'm tired. I feel like I haven't slept not once in those four years since then. \u000a\u000aThey're staring at me /right now/ you know. As I type this they stare at me. Have you ever tried to sleep with someone's eyes on you, watching you breathe? \u000a\u000aI'm scared. \u000aPlease, listen.\u000a4 years ago, my grandmother sat next to me as I lay in a hospital bed.

VHi everyone. Fancy meeting you here.\u000a\u000aI think... I think it is time for me to go. I'm a 19 year old, who all his life has waited to get out of his abusive parents house, and now that I am out... I feel... disenchanted with the world.\u000a\u000aIn high school I was a prodigy. I was smart, 34 on my ACT, track and cross country team captain. I played the violin pretty well too, good grades, everything was great. I worked really hard to be the goody goody and do everything perfectly to one day get the hell away from home.\u000a\u000aHere I am, a year after leaving. I got a minor in consumption a month ago, and just got a speeding ticket for going 103 in a 75. I drink regularly, I had a girlfriend who was morbidly depressed and a drug addict--I have since left her--I'm on a cross country team and nobody likes me. I am half the man I used to be. I just have become a piece of shit overall. Average. Below average. Worthless.\u000a\u000aWhat's more, I have reached a point where I don't even really care about what other people think. Nobody is really close to me anymore. I am pretty much alone. I have some friends, but nobody close enough that they wouldn't be able to get over me.\u000a\u000aI guess I just... I just want a painless way to leave. To stop having to try so damn hard. I thought life will be easy after I escape home, yet here I am, barely making it through life. I wanted to be a doctor one day. Its a lot of work. I don't have the motivation.\u000a\u000aI think the world would just be a little better without me, and even if it wouldn't, I feel like I don't really want to be part of the world.\u000a\u000aIdk. Maybe I won't do it. I just want someone to here me. Idk. I just don't know.

VI keep finding myself hoping that my mom dies so it's easier for me to kill myself. I feel it so genuinely, and yet it makes my stomach hurt to think about. Everyone says I'm getting better and that the medication is working, but I feel so much worse. I need to kill myself.  I have a gut feeling that it doesn't matter and I should just do it. My stomach hurts so fucking bad and I'm sweaty all the time. If you read this please go help someone else here instead, I think I'm too far gone and there are people here who can actually be helped. I can't believe that I would wish misfortune on literally the greatest person in my entire life just so I could end it quicker. I think I'm losing my mind, I talk to my psychologist and I feel like I'm watching the conversation. I watch myself lie and act and then wonder why he thinks I'm improving.

VMy life has utterly fallen apart. My boyfriend and I had a fight last night and he left. It's 4 am now and I haven't heard from him. He defended his right to swear at me if I am being "disrespectful," something I apparently stumbled into accidentally while joking around about a board game. This relationship was the last bit of hope for my life.\u000a\u000aBut that's neither here nor there. I have a plan I can carry out. I have my suicide note mentally written. I'll write down my passwords to everything and where I'd like my money to go. I'll take a picture of the note and post it to Facebook. \u000a\u000aThe worst part is that I won't be able to see people's reactions. I want people to realize that it's not okay to treat me the way I've been treated. I want there to be regret. I want there to be change. I want people to see what they've done and the effect their unkindness has on others. I want them to realize that they had a friend in me and didn't appreciate it. But I'll never see all that. And maybe it's a blessing, because my hopes for all those things would probably not be realized. My death will be a mere blip on the radar. People will shrug their shoulders, now confirmed in their belief that I am crazy, and get on with life.

V**TL;DR:** Helped she overcome mental illness. She just asked for divorce and left me completely alone.\u000a\u000aBefore anything, please bear with me as I'm not a native english speaker (I'm from Brazil).\u000a\u000aI'm in REAL necessity of some comforting words right now.\u000a\u000aI'm 28 years old guy. My relationship of 6 years ended some days ago when my SO asked for divorce.\u000a\u000aWe have lived together for 5 years and in a few weeks from now she will leave to another, far away, state where her family lives.\u000a\u000aI've met her when she was almost 18, and I was 22. She had the greatest heart I've ever known to this day, but she was very lost in her psyche and mentally broken. She was depressed and had a LOT of self esteem problems and traumas from her childhood. Anyway I held her side and supported her throughout the years, making sure that she remained stable as possible.\u000a\u000aEven with the financial challenges (as I was the only that could work due to her psychological instabilities) I've made sure that she seek help and arranged everything for her to start therapy to get mentally better. She did. After that I provided her the means to study and take courses in the things she was interested in. And she also did. She was way overweight so I convinced her to start going to a nutritionist and starting hitting the gym. She lost a lot of weight and gained a lot of health.\u000a\u000aI have devoted all my time and money for our life together and our future. And now, years later, she's a completely different person, for better or worse.\u000a\u000aNow she wants freedom. Absolute freedom. Freedom to not to have to "answer to anyone", to live as she, and only she, sees fit. To meet anyone at anytime and any place. She fell in love with the concept of an "open relationship". She can't stand living with someone anymore, and wants to (in her words) "leave work on friday with friends and have a good time until monday morning". \u000a\u000aMaybe she didn't live her teenager years as she wanted and wants to overcompensate now, I don't know.\u000a\u000aI was never really a "people person". All my life I was very shy and distant. I've grew up without brothers and friends, and my parents were overprotective. My "brother dog" that I had from my teen years died when I was 20, my mother died when I was 22, my distant sister died when I was 24, my father died when I was 25. I only have a few family members alive, and they're all old and live far away. I have some work colleagues but absolutely no one I can call friend. Now the last person whose I had some kind of intimacy, the last person close to me, is going away forever.\u000a\u000aThis will be the first time in my life that I will be completely alone, without any kind of closer support.\u000a\u000aI'm trying hard to keep my head distracted in my free time. But it is hurting like hell, I want to cry all the time, everything remembers her and all the things we did as a couple. Sleeping is hard and eating almost impossible. For now we're still living in the same roof and in relative peace, as there is a lot of things to work out before she can leave.\u000a\u000aI'm afraid, I'm lost, I feel empty. The mere thought of killing myself gives me warmth.\u000a\u000aI am hopeless, please help me.

VI've struggled with clinical depression, OCD, ADHD, and severe anxiety issues since I was a child. \u000a\u000aBasically, my parents are Indian, and I am just a white washed kid who has tons of mental health issues. \u000aI don't really want to type out my whole life story here however, here's a bit from my written suicide letters to my parents: \u000a\u000a" You guys ridicule me for everything even depression, or something like ADHD. \u000aOCD for sure can be used as an example,considering so many members of our family have it, yet you fail to believe so. Or the simple fact that you guys fail to see any wrong in our family, and the fact that any mental issue should be shamed and is faked (or in mom\u2019s perspective, not be linked to her side of the family). \u000aThe smallest details can drive me to insanity due to my OCD, even my psychologist told you guys how severe it is. I can't do anything the correct way I want to. Everything is wrong and not the way I want it to be and it drives me mad and causes me to have mental breakdowns. \u000aMy ADHD symptoms lead me to not concentrate in class. My mind wanders constantly, and though I may be interested in the subject my mind leads me to another path and I hate it. \u000aThen there's my depression, which tells me everyday that all of this can be stopped if I just die. No tomorrow means none of this. No more breakdowns. No more anything. It makes it seem right, in which makes me wonder, maybe it is\u2026\u000a\u000aMaking fun of the fact that I have a mental illness is never good, joking saying \u201cyour whole body is fine, except for your brain\u201d. Remarks like that have a toll like no other. If any organ in the body can have a problem, so can the brain, and that\u2019s not a silly saying, it's reality. If we can't make diabetes go away, how would depression work? \u000aI mean in reality you can\u2019t ridicule me when you feel there are bad spirits in the house and that's why I'm depressed and not smart, and that smoke from sage can make them go away, cause in the grand scheme of things, a lot of your obsessive beliefs are just as ridiculous as mine. However, if I say anything, I will more than likely cause a conflict, causing you to get more angry at me."\u000a\u000aThat's just a small glimpse of things, however my parents are major helicopter parents, and also narcissists and if I say anything they will yell back at me, and say rude things, and also make me go down a deeper hole.\u000a\u000aNow our story gets interesting Homecoming night in September , I left mad at my dad due to him telling me that I was an idiot for going on a date and that I shouldn't date or talk with girls and focus on friends till I get a job and after college, I had a night full of drama (since my date started acting awkward and weird), and by 10o\u2019clock I was in tears because my life has never gone the way I had desired. \u000aFor some, people saw me as the guy who won homecoming royalty, however inside I\u2019ve been broken forever. \u000aNow, solving your problems with alcohol isn\u2019t a proper solution, however I really needed a release that wasn\u2019t death. I only ever even touched alcohol since I was in pain all that\u2019s gone on in my life, and homecoming was where it all went down. \u000a\u000aI lied once I was caught, and said I was forced to take it at school by students, causing the school to get involved. Luckily I was honest and came to my senses at the meeting with the dean, however since then my parents have locked me down 100% and I'm lost on what to do. \u000aI haven't been able to hang out with a friend since then, anything I do has to be closely monitored, and I just got my phone back so they can track my location 24/7.\u000a\u000aI'm a failure in their eyes. I'm a Junior who went from a 4.0 to a 2.8 GPA, and my SAT is in a couple weeks, and if I don't get a good grade on that then my dad says he will disappointed. \u000a\u000aI mean on the other side of things I do have a website where I share my music related stuff since I am a DJ and I really also want to help people create websites easily, just I know that won't kick off most likely, and my parents don't see any value for something rediculous like that. \u000aI lied saying that I coded it, but really used a CMS, with minimal code, and just added a ton of effort to make things look good.\u000a\u000aI am failure in my own eyes, and I'm losing it by the minute.\u000a\u000aI don't know what to do. \u000a\u000aSorry for the long post, just needed to let somethings out of my mind.

This is much worse than I am acknowledging to my own self right now. \u000a\u000aFor my entire life I have been severely bullied (first time I'm ever acknowledging this properly), and it all started with my family. I was the scapegoat, and imprisoned, tortured, brainwashed, and controlled are the words that come to mind when I think about what I survived. Last year I finally escaped and I haven't looked back; I went completely no contact with my narc/sociopathic family. I've had a year of psychotherapy with the most incredible psychologist who I deeply trust. Unfortunately this has been so expensive and I don't have a lot of savings, so I can no longer afford to see him. I need therapy though, and medication most likely, which I have avoided until now. \u000a\u000aI have absolutely no family support. I have no relatives I could reach out to either. So I'm alone and I feel very vulnerable. The few good friends I have live far away but I do reach out to them online a bit. As for friends in real life, I do not trust anyone at the moment. I struggle to bond with people because I do not easily trust people and I am extremely guarded. I have attracted the wrong kind, so I feel I need space to heal and build my confidence and trust again.\u000a\u000aI was never exposed to the real world. I'm only now learning of its true horrors. For an idealist who dreams of world peace, it is absolutely terrifying to me, and I feel such deep despair and sadness about all the cruelty I am witnessing and experiencing myself. How can it be that the world is this cold and brutal? I see moments of beauty, but it feels like nothing compared to the awfulness that's out there. I know I need to accept the reality of life, I need to accept that things are just this way. I don't know how to. I don't want to.\u000a\u000aThe main cause of these feelings is work. I have been suffering for 1.5 years at this company. I'm stuck there right now because I can't afford to be unemployed and I'm too anxious/depressed//scared/weak to pass these interviews, even though I always get them when I apply. I am such an easy target in the workplace. I haven't yet learned how to blend in and I refuse to 'play the game', but sometimes it feels necessary. I refuse to sacrifice my integrity, but I also need to stand up for myself more. Bullies love me. I am always kind, nice, helpful, I am also competent and smart, I don't have bad looks, and I am 'different' (super introverted, individualistic, in my own world at times, can appear weird to certain types). Working in an all female environment, with a few sociopaths thrown in, has meant that from day one I was their target. From day one they ate me alive and they're still chewing me up. I have cried myself to sleep and felt so hurt and disappointed for so long now. Not only at them for doing it to me, in fact it's more that they have to be this way at all.\u000a\u000aThere has been some relief. My current manager saw me struggling, she's one of the only decent people there, and moved me onto her team, but it's still in the same department. Only thing now is a couple of my new coworkers are very sinister and evil, and have been poisoned by my old coworkers. One of them, I called her out, and she has stopped her bullying now. The other... :( ... I'm so manipulated by him. He is twisted and sick in the head. I have to call him out but I'm scared! I was going to last night, but instead he fucked me over. I went out with him and a few others. He gave me a pill and I was really drunk. Him and his sociopathic friend really fucked with me when I was out of it. Seriously fucked with me, but I can't exactly tell you how, you know? A lot of it was their energy, I could feel them both feeding off of my confusion/suffering, being emotional vampires.\u000a\u000aI left, ran the fuck away to get home, told them I was sick. He knows I know what he's doing, and he knows I'm too weak to stand up for myself right now. He is loving it. He intimidates me at work to the point where I cannot really be myself. What the fuck do I do!? I can't tell management because that place is pathologically organized and they encourage competition and bullying. Do I confront him and say listen I know what you're doing and I'm asking you to stop? I tried before and he denied it and makes out he loves me and all this shit, only to still bitch about me and subtly fuck with me time and time again. He has made friends with my other sociopathic colleagues who still want to fuck with me (just not as much), and no doubt has told them what I trusted him with. WHAT DO I DO!? Do I keep on fighting back? I know what the alternative is like, and that's suffering in silence. I have to try a new approach. The new employee who took my old job is being bullied badly by them as well. Yesterday I sat with them and he said to me "Did they bully you as much as they're bullying me!? Is that why you moved? Can we switch places!?" He said that in front of them!! I was shocked... One of them said, "That's a sore subject we don't talk about..." and I said "Resilience. Strength. You must and will learn these things from this team. It's also a heavy topic to talk about on a Friday afternoon so let's leave it alone." Why do you think he did that!? I think it wasn't his place to air my business like that publicly, but maybe he was trying to get some support from me? What do you think? I know he likes me and cares about me, but he's very heavily manipulated/controlled by them so now I don't talk to him much. I'm thinking to talk to him on Monday about it - wondering if that's a good idea...?\u000a\u000aIt was so bad last night that I asked strangers for help, and two guys took me home and really helped me. It was absolutely amazing of them, they saved me...but I invited them into my home! I just trusted them into my home, you know!? I feel so vulnerable for that, but I needed the support. \u000a\u000aAlso I'm even more fragile right now because a couple days ago I broke things off with a sociopath I was seeing... I can't believe it, no matter how many times I think I've learned, I'm still vulnerable to these types of people. I naively thought he was a genuinely kind guy, you know, everything I could have wanted, it was fantastic. Then I went on vacation with him and then he showed me his real face... :(... He kept picking on me, and he even said to me walking home late on the empty foreign streets, "What if I was a psychopath and just used chloroform on you right now...?" I said "Why would you say that!? You're scaring me." and he said "Shut the fuck up, of course I'd never hurt you! How the fuck could you question me? How could you think this... I doubt I can forgive you for this, etc." :(... I foolishly let him back into my room that night, and I broke down crying, with images of old abusive ex-boyfriends flashing in my mind, huge alarm bells ringing. He whispered "I'm so sorry" into my ear and held me, and in that moment I could have died. His eyes were dead and cold, and I knew I had been duped again. AGAIN. Again.. It is just so painful to know I opened up to another one of these parasitic scumbags. I know these people are calculated and very clever, but I'm kicking myself because I just should have known. :( I'm proud that I at least called him out. On the flight home, I said "You're a bully. A BULLY. Does it make you feel like a big man to pick on vulnerable girls like me?" He said, "Yeah, I feel like a big man, probably to make my dick feel bigger." I said "Probably." (I didn't have sex with him so that's a relief, and probably he hates women because of that very reason...) He also said, "You know bullies like me don't like being called out on their shit", and I said, "Well I just did. I'm not afraid of people like you. I know how you work, I'm not a fucking idiot, think you can emotionally manipulate me and give me shitty eye contact to try to fucking intimidate me!" He didn't like that, was visibly angry. I was so proud of myself in that moment!! I felt so empowered and strong!! \u000a\u000aAnyway... back to being alone again. I cannot trust anyone right now. If you've read this far, thank you for reading... If there's anything you can suggest or recommend to help my mental state, please do... I don't know how I'm going to survive. I really don't. I don't know what I can do. I'm so scared to lose my job, scared I'll end up homeless or a drug addict, scared to have no money, scared of being stuck forever, scared to stay in this job or find a new one where I may have more of the same, scared of everyone and everything. Scared of my state of mind. I feel like glass that's shattered into a thousand pieces.\u000a\u000a

VI have been bullied for years at work about my disability. But this week has been the worst. The two men I work with have given me hell. One guy is because I won't fuck him. The other is just an idiot that doesn't understand, so whatever he doesn't understand he attacks and mocks. \u000a\u000aI feel so bad. \u000a\u000aI just can't take crap anymore. \u000a\u000a"Stand up for yourself." \u000a\u000aI've tried. Nothing phases them at all. \u000a\u000a"Oh, they don't do that. You are just being silly. They are nice guys." \u000a\u000aDo you seriously think for one fucking moment that they would mock and abuse a co worker in front of you, with you being the boss? Are you that fucking stupid? \u000a\u000a"You should take legal action." \u000a\u000aWho cares. I'm better off dead.

VI have a head ache and I'm nauseous and I feel like I'm hungover but I'm not and I can't think straight but I'll just try to say what I'm thinking even if it's all jumbled up.\u000a\u000aI guess this most recent episode (the one I'm in now) was brought on by the thought of graduation in June. I'm 17 and I don't know how it happened. I don't want to grow up, I want to go back to being a kid or 14 at least. Life is pretty shitty now but what makes it even worse is that it's always been bad one way or another. I've had problems with anxiety and later depression for as long as I can remember. Through time it's manifested under different forms; first by skipping school (which I still do, more on that later), then by cutting and now I eat too much and throw up. So it's really always been hard and terrible just to be alive but I still want to go back because I don't know how to move forward. I look back on my life and there's nothing. I quit and I miss out on everything because I was too anxious or sad or shy and I stayed home. I've missed so much school I don't know how I know anything. I don't do anything. I stay at home on the internet all day because I don't know what to do with myself. I wanted to be in band and choir but I quit because I would get overwhelmed and stop showing up. The same thing happened with tae kwon do, gymnastics, piano, a million other things that I started but couldn't finish. So what do I have now? Nothing. I'm barely alive. Sometimes it gets better and I wonder how I could ever have felt bad a day in my life but then without fail it always gets worse again. That's the only constant in my life, that no matter how high I get sooner or later I'm going to slip and end up back where I am right now. Everything else is temporary. \u000a\u000aMaybe it's worth telling you that I've been throwing up on the reg for, shit, five years now? I think I've ruined my teeth but I'm not about to ask anyone. Maybe it's strange to be suicidal over your teeth but it's important to me. It's like a shitty metaphor. Even if I stop being crazy around food and never throw up again a day in my life and completely get better physically my teeth are never going to 'get better' with me. They're always going to be there to remind of what a stupid worthless fuckup I am. So why stop purging? Why get better? Why not just keeping binging and purging until it kills me? As it is I don't like to smile or talk in a way that shows my teeth because I don't want anyone to see them. Without exaggeration I can tell you that everyone in my life has straight white teeth. Maybe you don't think teeth are a big deal but they are. They're among the first things you notice when talking face to face with someone. Everyone thinks yellow rotting teeth are disgusting, I know I do. They reflect  poorly on their wearer. Who can't take care of their own teeth? Apparently me. Veneers could help but they're around 2000 a pop. My parents aren't badly off but that's far too much to ask. And you tell me how I'm going to get a job when I can't even leave the house half the time. Everything comes back to money, but that's nothing new. Sometimes I think having perfect teeth would fix everything because at least then I could laugh and smile and not feel so ugly but I know that's probably not true because there's always something else, isn't there? As soon as you fix one problem another one comes up. Besides, my teeth are only one part of this mess. There are plenty of other things.\u000a\u000aOther things. I don't know if I'd ever be able to properly explain or convey through text how useless and ugly and stupid and dull and pathetic and disgusting I am. I disgust myself. Why?? How can I explain why I am the way I am if I don't even know? I'm boring, I have no personality. Sometimes it's because I'm too shy and other times it's because my head is completely empty and I couldn't come up with something to say to save my life. I'm lazy. I have no work ethic. I've missed so much school I don't know how I haven't been expelled. I spend all my time at home doing nothing. I'm not particularly talented at anything. Maybe it would help to pick up a hobby but I have no idea which one and I'd probably give up on it anyway. I'm worse than useless because I leech off of everything. It took me all day to write this post because I spent 4+ hours binging on insane amounts of food and purging. I've lost hundreds of days like this. It's beyond pathetic. Why can't I leave the house? Why do I have to be the way I am?? It's like it wouldn't be enough just to die; I shouldn't have ever existed in the first place. \u000a\u000aI had more to say but I can't remember. Seems like I'm just repeating myself at this point anyway. It's taken me all day to write this and I don't know if it makes much sense. I keep telling myself to try and reach out to someone or something but I haven't managed until now. If I had a reliable way to off myself I wouldn't be here so there isn't much to lose either way.

VI really don't. My mom has MS, and I've never given her the attention she deserves. I've treated her like trash cause I never helped out enough. She pushed through so much day to day and all I could do my whole life was be a brat. I used to wonder why our family wasn't like others, why we didn't go out and do things really, why when I got home from school all my mom would do was read, or why she would be really grumpy all the time. I knew my mom had MS and I knew what it meant but I still complained, and when I was younger my mom and I fought a lot, which was stupid, i was just being stupid cause it wasnt her fault.\u000a A couple years ago she told me that she used to not care whether she lived or died. This really bothered me, because if she had tried to take her life I would have been partially responsible. I never helped her enough, I tried to act like everything was normal and I would get angry when she didnt want to do things.\u000a\u000aIve had mood disorders for most of my life, the first being anixety, and in recent years depression. Im at college now and I cant help but feel regret for not doing more for her. Her illness will only get worse from here, as MS is, so Ill have to watch my mother physically fall apart. There are a lot of reasons why I hate myself and why I have issues, but ive always held this deep guilt of trying to be a normal. When I got to college I felt so free because I could do things whenever I wanted to, I didnt have to stay home because my mom wasnt feeling up to going out or I would feel bad if she was home alone. I realized I dont know how to function normally really. I dont deserve this because i never did enough for anyone. \u000a\u000aSo I try not to think about these thoughts anymore and I tucked them away, but today I watched an anime called "orange" and damn it really hit me hard. I shouldnt have watched it, because i reminded me of how i never did enough for my mother and would get angry at her for her disability. now ive just been crying about this all night and i feel like a loser. I feel like i dont even deserve to live. im pathetic.

Vi wanted to kill myself since i was like 10, and i fucked it up twice, i kept going because i thought that it HAS to get easier, it didnt, lifes only getting worse, i managed to sell enough weed to pay for deposit and rent for a month and i found a job, it took me over two years to find work, but i kept getting in shit for things i didnt do at work and when i tried explaining myself i just get replies like "stop with the excuses" and "why do i lie so much", im getting fired on the 12th and i saved up enough money to last me 2 more months rent if i eat almost nothing, after that i think im done, life isnt for me, and i tried i really did, but nothing seemed to work, as if i kept pushing forward, i thought i was making progress, but in reality i wasnt going anywhere. i have nobody, i hate my fucking broken family, i cant go back to sharing a bedroom between me and my brother that treats me like shit, so after i run out of money i decide to kill myself, just whats the point, i was so motivated to get my shit together but it did NOTHING, and i have no emotional support from anybody because i cant make a single friend, i dont have a real connection with anybody, i tried making friends but my trust issues take me way too long to be friendly with anybody, so everyone leaves, i just hope in my next life ill be born as some dumb ignorant fuck thats the sheep of the society, so i no longer have to think the way i do now, i used to do every drug i could get my hands on to stop myself from thinking depressing shit, it worked but when i quit everything all these suicidal thoughts more than doubled, yea im rambling on but i have nobody that would hear me out anyway so i might as well post this here, so yea, ive given up, i can truly say that after 18 years of life, i went through way too much shit, and for these 18 years i was strong enough to keep going, after i run out of money im just going to jump under a train or something, i dont give a shit if its a selfish act, ive been selfless for so long, and when i cared about myself it only lead to more trouble, whatever i do im punished as if someones playing sick games on me.

VHi /r/SuicideWatch .\u000a\u000aEven you have it in the rules, one of the first things people read on the sidebar of this subreddit is that guilt-tripping is strictly forbidden (1a). However, this is probably the only reason, or one of a few, why I'm staying alive. Because your loved ones are the ones that will yelp "but what about me and my feelings?!?!" the moment you talk about potentially killing yourself. Many of us are conditioned into being needed, and now have trouble getting over it. I'm one of those people. \u000a\u000aAs much as I don't want to hurt anyone with my death, I understand that it doesn't justify me continuing my presence on this planet. On a global scale, I'll hurt less than a couple billionths of a percent of the entire Earth population - that's a drop in the ocean and humanity will easily get over it. \u000a\u000aCome to think of it, we all care about our own lives before anybody else's... I mean, if my mom or dad died, I'd grieve, I'd be lost and devastated, but dying is a part of life. And if my mom or dad committed suicide due to the emotional or physical pain they cannot overcome, I'd be no less lost and devastated, but I'd be happy for them that they don't have to suffer anymore. Mom does not share that logic though. She wouldn't be happy that I don't suffer here anymore. She would only think about her feelings - that's normal, that's human. However, I'm just a part of the crowd of people surrounding her, even if one of the closest. She conditioned me into the idea that I'm to be responsible for her grief if I commit suicide. And I cannot get over it. \u000a\u000aSo, I need another reason to live. Long story short, I want to commit suicide because I hate how selfish, gross, inconsiderate, harmful, parasitic, sex-driven, emotional humans are. And since I'm one of the humans... hey, I can spare the world from one of these awful creatures, wouldn't that be awesome?\u000a\u000aTherefore, I need help getting over this reason to stay alive and f'k off this existence with a clear conscience. Alternatively, I need help with finding another reason to stay alive, although I don't hold my hopes up in this department. \u000a\u000aThank you for your time!

VI have no interests that aren't tied to suicide somehow, and I have very few of them as is. I have no support net except for my sibling, as the few friends I still have left think I hate them because i never talk to them. I don't find talking to friends, new or old, worth the effort anymore because fully caring about anyone has always been near imposible for me. \u000a\u000aMy sibling found out about my last (doomed to fail) suicide attempt and inadvertently guilt tripped the shit out of me. I dont know how to deal with comforting someone over my own death. It eas incomfortablr and didn't help me at all, but has worked in postponing it for a bit.\u000a\u000aI normally wouldn't care. I will die and not deal with the consequences of my death, so it's fairly ineffective for me, but this sneak peak to my funeral was kind of. I don't know. I don't know what else to do. I have something that will definitely work, but guilt at seeing my younger sibling like that is bothering me.\u000a\u000aI want to stay alive for myself and my own reasons, not somebody else, but I don't have any. I'm a college dropout, I'm too damn mentally ill to work consistently and more than 3-4 hours, I'm too paranoid, I'm trying and failing to process the fact that I'm severely delusional, I have bad fits where I get violent enough for my family to think I'll hurt them, I've been kicked out of my mother's house and have been mooching off a relative who is also going to kick me out, and I'll have no choice but to be living with my abusive father in the near future, and I hate absolutely everything. My emotional range consists of void, anger, or anxiety, it's ridiculous.\u000a\u000aI don't see the point in bothering because i know two or three people who aren't absolutely terrible. I truly want to find my own reasons, but as I said I'm so fixated on the idea of dying and have been for so long that I can't imagine anything else no matter how much I try.

VI've been alone all day, have no one to come see me. Tomorrow is my boyfriend's 21st birthday and his parents are probably going to make him stay there all day. I'm a total failure. I have one friend and she's probably sick to death of me. I can't talk to anyone about how I feel because no one wants to hear it. \u000a\u000aI have plenty of ways to do it, too. It would be really easy to make it so no one would ever be irritated by me again. I wish I could handle being all alone, I thought I was better. I'm not.

VI used to do well and worked in an office for 5 years. Stopped working for 3 years to focus on raising a family. I'm now thinking of going back to work as savings is running out but I don't want to work in an office environment anymore. My mom and brother work as caregivers for the elderly and I feel like I'll be happy working like them but I can't get over the fact I'm downgrading from office work to caregiver.   I have this fear people would judge me or laugh at me when they find out I work as a caregiver. I'm so incredibly depressed and scared to the point that I don't have the courage to look for a job anymore. Please help me be confident again.

VMy adoptive parents basically walked out of my life again for the second time. My dad who I was closest too said I was abusive and didn't want me in his life anymore. He went so far as to file harrasement against me multiple times. So I just gave up trying. I have always had problems with addictions in the past and dealing with trauma and I've always been suicidal I guess. My dad moved about an hour away and is getting remarried for the 3rd or 4th time and has a new family and I don't matter anymore. My mom stopped speaking to me as well, she said I was extremely codependent and needed to learn not to be. Our relationships always felt one sided. I always had to go to them. They never came to see me. My dad said all I ever do is like to play the victim when he would never listen to me. They think it's all my fault our relationship didn't work or last and they admit no guilt in anything. I really just don't want to live anymore. My grandparents have both died in the last two years. My blood siblings are drug addicts and alcoholics that only contact me when they need money or a ride. I am attending therapy and on medication but I am just so lonely and in pain all of the time. I don't want to go on without a family. I want all the pain and darkness to just swallow me up. Maybe my adoptive parents would be happier that way. What hurts the most is not being able to talk to my little sister who is about to turn 9. I'm sure they tell her I'm just some worthless drug addict and alcoholic, I love all of them and I have struggled with alcoholism but all I do now is work as much as possible in a large factory at night and sleep all day and take pills. I have tears writing this. I hope they are happier without me.

Vi read stories on here almost every day. y'all struggling with abuse, family issues, money problems... i barely have any of those. i was emotionally (and physically, occasionally) abused as a kid and affording college is tough -- but not to an extent that would make me feel like this. \u000a\u000ai have good friends, but none that i feel like i can talk to about this. i'm at a great university, undeclared first year, so i haven't wasted that much money on something i don't love yet. my ex-girlfriend, the only person i'm really comfortable with, said i could call her if i really needed support but she's happy now so i don't want to bother her with my bullshit, she's so much better off without me. and i feel like my parents are disappointed in my performance, but i don't really think i'm doing that bad. my dad criticizes me so often but i have a 3.0 (which i thought was ok for freshmen?) and his words only demotivate me and make me want to work on school less. i have a very supportive brother (who is a few years older and goes to the same college as me), but he is also very depressed so i don't want to bring him even further down.\u000a\u000amusic is my only outlet but i spend so much time making it that i just get even further behind on my studies. i'm not good enough at it to make a career out of it and nobody in my life (except my ex) is supportive of it. my dad says i spend too much time on the computer, my bro says my music is weird, anxious, and not really that good. and my mom is really submissive so she just agrees with whatever the fuck the rest of my family says.\u000a\u000aevery day i wake up hoping it'll be my last. there's a parking garage near my apartment that i could easily jump off but i don't want someone to find me. and in the rare chance that i survive, i'll just be living with even more guilt. i don't even have that much to feel bad about but i just want to die. i used to feel positive emotions all the time but now i'm literally just doing everything i can to not make that jump\u000a\u000ahow do you all find purpose for life?

VI signed up and made this post because I want someone to read in my own words what is going through my head.  I feel as though I'm drowning in myself at this point.  I started having trouble coping with things when I was sixteen or seventeen.  It took a while, but several years later I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder.  It made sense.  I had terrifying mood swings and saw/heard things that still scare me.  It has been almost ten years since then with no end in sight.  I haven't completed more than two semesters of college without having an episode and either failing or dropping out, I haven't been able to keep a steady job, I haven't been able to maintain real, meaningful relationships, and I am still unable to feel as though I'm living an existence of any worth.  I feel as though a large part of my sadness is how dull and lifeless I feel.  My medication saps me of any real feeling and I can hardly stand to think about how incapable it makes me feel.  I don't enjoy being off of it either - it leads to one of two things: depression or mania followed by depression.  I've tried on three separate occasions to kill myself.  I was only halfhearted about it the first time, but the other two were a shade away from death.  I'm off of my medication again (my new insurance can't cover it/I can't pay for it) and I don't want to struggle like this any longer.  I just want a death with some amount of dignity.  I don't want to upset anyone that I know.  Even then, I've grown distant from my family and I no longer have close friends, but I don't think it'd matter if that wasn't the case.  It's just that I know that I'll be unable to live life on my own terms, so I'd at least like to end it on them.

For years I learned to shut down the thoughts and became a very introverted, painfully shy and numb person. \u000aLast year things bubbled over and my self harm, bulimic tendencies and general anxiety came to light and everything became 1,000x worse. The thought of death was comfort to me. \u000aRecently a doctor put me on antidepressants. I took them for two days and they made me throw up and not eat for nearly a week. I'm on new ones but I haven't taken them yet. I plan to try tomorrow morning. \u000a\u000aMy question is, how will drugs fix an issue I've been dealing with for nearly a decade?

VI'm sorry if this offends, or discourages anyone, or "triggers" them, but I need to get it off my chest. I've been depressed for so many years, and been in "recovery" for a little over a year, but I need to get it off. Even if it's just typing words on a small forum that no one will read, please let me just get it off. \u000a\u000aFUCK the idea of getting help. Everything about it. I would never say that getting help is why I will do it but it certainly pushed me to it. \u000a\u000aFuck getting hospitalized, and the complete fucking waste of time it is, when you don't speak to anyone except a psych once a day. It's fucking awful, demoralizing, and makes we want to die, every second I'm there. \u000a\u000aFuck psychiatrists, and how they don't give a single fuck about you, and how they see you for five minutes, and how they are never concerned about how you feel, but instead judge you for doing shit. That's all life is, anyways, doing shit. "Oh, you're going to college and have a part-time job? Even though you say your symptoms are getting worse, these things indicate you're getting better!" Why doesn't anything work. \u000a\u000aFuck all my therapists I've had. Fuck the way my first one halves my appointments and started every single one talking on the phone. Fuck the third for invalidating everything I felt, and fuck my second for doing the same. It's like every feeling I have isn't real, therapists just half-ass their work, and I leave feeling worse every single time I go. Or I just get demoralized by them, and how that any single person who is a *little* too tough to get along with, you either A) Get hospitalized B) Get sent to another therapists or C) Get so shitted on so much and implied so many times that you should just fucking off yourself, you do what I leave and leave forever, and from the world forever. Getting asked if I'll even show up to my next time though I've never missed an appointment and pour my FUCKING LIFE into it, because what else do I have? Therapists don't give a fucking shit about you.\u000a\u000aFuck (ironically) forums like this, where you make posts, and fucking scream into the void about how you're so upset, and down at the world, that you would fucking KILL yourself, and are only met with silence. \u000a\u000aAnd fuck all of those things above, for treating me like a fucking bum, treating me like I don't matter. Like I didn't go my entire life being ridiculed for being poor, or deal with my drunk mother at home, like I deserve to be put down like an animal. Fuck everyone for ever happening.

VSo i'll start of by saying she has mental illnesses. She's fairly addicted to her pills, and has a lot of problems in general. She has this need to be someone's boyfriend or girlfriend, and without someone to tell her that they love them, she feels like trash. She is completely dependent on a significant other type of person. She's so desperate she's gone on tinder and has even slept with someone to try and get into a relationship.\u000aSince i've broken up with her, she's slumped into this self-hating thought process where all she wants to do is pop pills, and occasionally mentions that she should down the whole bottle to commit suicide... she's not joking either. I've helped her through a lot of these episodes and problems, but they're just temporary. I can't count how many times i've convinced her not to kill herself, and to be clear, it's not fake she has attempted this before.\u000aHer family does not care. If she tells them she's feeling suicidal, they laugh or tell her to shut up. From my brief time getting to know them, they're honestly probably the cause of her mental issues. They're also quite poor, sometimes they can't even pay for a meal all day because they need their paycheck first, so therapy for her isn't really an option. I'm the only thing keeping her sane.\u000a\u000a.\u000a\u000aHow do I more permanently help her? How do I take away her need for a boyfriend without filling that gap myself?

I know what you're thinking.  No there's honest to God nothing here in town.  Literally every person passing by me is over the age of 55. I'm trapped in a live in relationship that I don't want to be in but can't leave because I can't break the lease.  I just can't see things getting better.  I know these problems aren't the worst you ever heard but it's been like this so long.  I can't do it anymore.  I'm sick of not being able to connect to people.  I'm sick of working a soul crushing job.  I'm sick of feeling anxious and tired. I don't think any of the buildings are tall enough in this shit town anyway.  I just want it to end.  I'm tired of fighting to not want to die.  I'm tired of people not understanding.  I'm tired of explaining myself. If only I had the balls to take the one step necessary.

VI know people want to help, but I just need to say this out loud in some way before I get this over with. I'm 32 now, and I've been through hell my entire life. The tipping point just went by, when my long term girlfriend just told me that she won't be helping me rent a new place since she has to stay with her Father and go back to school, along with work on her mental issues. Without me. The main issue with that is that my credit is absolutely shot, and I've been living like a dog to save enough money to pay for a shit box apartment in the city, all in hopes that I could get back to work and pay for her to go to school. My current living situation is less than ideal, but I was willing to put up with it for the time being if things were going to get better. Unfortunately, I just needed her to help get a new lease and start working towards paying off my debt. This news just came to me after waiting for a year to get the fuck out of here. What's hilarious is just a couple years ago, I was popular, making good money, and things were workable. Being with this girl really put me through my paces and quite honestly, brought out a few mental issues of my own. I've slowly devolved to the point where she was my only friend. I have no family to speak of, and I've lost contact with literally everyone else. I've already been through psych, tried out the pill regimen, but it just wasn't me. The doctors were alright, but mostly I was rushed out once I wasn't a serious risk anymore. I'm not going to do this for attention, I'm just sick of the struggle and day to day grind, and the crushing loneliness. As someone who prides himself on being social, I've gone past rock bottom. This would probably be an easy fix if I hadn't taken on piles of student loans and owing for traffic fines, which I'm sure some people will scoff at and say it serves me right, but when you're just over 30 and owe 40K with no real income, we'll see how you fare. So that's just the surface. There are tons of other issues I could go into my past, but in the end, nothing really matters. No one will mourn me, no one will remember me, other than in a passing conversation. Fuck, no one will probably even come to identify my body, other than maybe this one social worker I was in contact with when I went for crisis counselling, since she told me a story about someone just like me having no family that killed themselves. Sad story that. Anyway, I don't want to really burden anyone more than I will be already so I'll just leave it at this. I'll be around to chat for the next couple hours, but I just want to get this over with before the sun goes down again.

VFor 4 years I have been locked up in my bedroom, very seldom do I see an outside face, I have hit the lowest of the low that a human being can get. There is no help I can recieve because I don't have health insurance, I can't see anymore doctors because I have no means to pay for it, I don't see my mom which makes life even harder, She works 3 jobs to pay for the previous bills I had racked up on her insurance. She's been going on 2 hours of sleep for 3 years now, working at the Honda factory, scioto cleaning services and Kroger. Even with three jobs she can't support me or herself anymore. She's losing the apartment and is moving in with her ex husband as a last resort. I haven't payed my taxes in a few years, I just can't exist anymore. I can't do anything I used to to do. My social media accounts have picture of me how I was 5 years ago. it would be a true embarrassment if anyone saw what I have became today and the current state of my appearance. I was taken advantage of 4-5 years ago by a Romanian woman on the internet, she pretended to be engaged with me for some money she needed. I took it really hard when she left out of my life abruptly after using me. Someone in her circle messages me on my twitter harassing me. saying that they would be happy for me to end my life. I messaged her on Facebook about it, it never says seen, but I sincerely asked her to stop, I think its her boyfriend getting enjoyment out of my suffering like its some kind of game, but since I asked her the messages have stopped. I have no one to talk to about this, I Have no way of receiving help. I really don't know what to do. I want to end my life so badly so very very badly, But i'm scared to do it and I think about my mom who's worked so hard to fix the damage all this has caused, I don't want to take my life, I can't do that to her because I love her very much, I can't go on like this though I know I can't go on for another few years like this. If I don't end up taking my own life I will soon end up catching the attention of my government for being  too dysfunctional to pay my own taxes or to get healthcare I don't mean to break the law, I'm not doing it on purpose I just can't go on anymore. my bed sheets fell of my bed 2 years ago, and they are laying in the same spot I haven't been able to barely move my energy is so low, I used to be a strong young man, but now I am so weak I can barely hold a jug of milk without my hands shaking, my bones feel brittle and weak and it makes me feel so helpless. I know if I go on another few years without paying my taxes that I might be taken to court and end up being fined, and being a helpless adult my mother is again going to take the burden. I'm so far down in this hell of mine that I don't see there being any way of recovery or a way out other than suicide. every year gets harder and harder and harder. while typing this I can barely write coherent sentences, I need to find help, I just don't know how to find it. I live in Ohio and can't find the help I need because I don't have any money.

Even though they're not the nicest people, I still dread the fact that I won't be able to see them more than 2 or 3 times a year. It pains me to think about the milestones I'll miss, and the fact that I won't see my little brother grow up.\u000a\u000aI hurt the girl I love the most yesterday. I just couldn't help it.

VI used to want to kill myself because I felt resentment towards existence. I never really understood it and wanted no part of it. I have also never felt like I belonged anywhere. This lead to me never trying in life, I dropped out of school, have never held a job for more than a few months and was just waiting for the right moment to end it. Around 2 years ago I got out of a long period of depression and decided to try to enjoy life and make the best of it. I have been trying for the last couple of years now and failing at everything, this is even worse. I am way behind everyone. I have no social skills. I just found out that a group of people I work with have been shit talking me behind my back. So now even when someone new comes that I get along with the first day, they won't even look at me when I say hi the next day. I'll probably quit again soon. Move somewhere else, alone. I am just really tired, I can't even imagine being happy. I don't know what to do, where to go, who to be... I am coming to the realization that I will kill myself sooner or later because this is relentless. This time around it actually makes me sad. This time I wanted it to work out and I just don't know how to. I am too out of place everywhere, I don't understand anything. I just want to get out of my head.

VI have lost 3 years of my life, recently found out I was diagnosed with Dissociative Identity Disorder in those 3 years I can't remember...I just...this scares me...I feel like I have no one...everything is different from 3 years ago...I can't take this anymore...I feel like no one cares or would care...why would anyone want to care for someone who is mentally fucked up? I don't want this..I can't live like this....and the only friend I still have seems so distant and different from what I remember....it hurts so much...I lost everything that my life used to be...\u000a\u000aEdit: We are ok. She was extremely worried because our roommate/best friend is out of country and didn't write anything today, so she worried that she killed herself or that she doesn't want to talk to us anymore and blamed herself, then the new soap caused a flashback and she cut. But it is not dangerous and I think she will calm down. Sorry for making everyone worry and thanks for the support! F.

VHopefully some of you can relate. I don't know if anyone even cares enough to read this, but I'm on my last leg today. \u000a\u000aEver since I can remember, I've felt like it was in my cards to kill myself. Growing up, I was fat, ugly, and had an issue with excessive crying, bursting out into tears in class since I was in preschool. It never went away. I would have to be removed from elementary school constantly because I would just BURST out crying. Just always fantasizing about death and how I didn't deserve to be alive. My dad was pretty mean and hit me sometimes, but it was mostly yelling and swearing at me, never rape or anything ridiculously bad. \u000a\u000aWhen he hit me, I felt like I deserved it, because I was a "bad" kid for always crying in school and freaking out. Turns out the freaking out and crying was because I had OCD as an actual child, which is fairly rare. If I couldn't count in order or if I had an intrusive thought about contamination or God smiting me, I would cry. Had this occurred in adulthood, maybe I could have handled it with more grace, but when you're 7 and you "hear God tell you in your head that you have tapeworms," what are you supposed to do but have a panic attack?\u000a\u000aMy parents refused treatment for me because they said "I would grow out of it." This ostracized me at school to the point of other girls and boys calling me "psycho." I would wash my hands in the bathroom for 35 minutes and get in trouble for it, then get dragged back into the middle school classroom, crying. And, obviously, middle school girls + weird girl with bleeding hands= extreme bullying for me. \u000a\u000aThis identity has never left me. I now feel like the crazy girl, and I eventually believed them when they said I should kill myself. I still feel like I am a freak. I used to do the whole shebang, the twitching face, the opening and closing the classroom door... I was a fucking freak and I would have been freaked out, too. My whole childhood, gone. I never had a childhood. I'm only going to live once, so now that the best years of my life are nothing, why keep living?\u000a\u000aI never had a single friend growing up. Not one. My only friend was food, or my mom. This is pathetic. I would take it out on my mom (telling her I wished she was dead, calling her horrific swears, saying I wished I was aborted, threatening to kill myself to make her afraid as a kid). I didn't KNOW why I was so pissed at her... but in retrospect, I guess I was pissed because she would not help me... she just kept me her helpless, psychotic baby who still needed reassurance and help getting dressed in the morning. A part of me thinks she liked it... I was so mentally ill in 7th grade, I was afraid to touch my clothes because of "germs on them." My mother had to dress me when I was 12 years old. Still, no therapy allowed. Every day felt like fucking war. I lost 20 lbs from anxiety, I was too afraid to eat because I thought "there were aliens in my food." OCD as a kid SUCKS, because you don't have a great grip on reality to begin with...\u000a\u000aThis hurts me and keeps me up at night to this day, because my mother is actually the sweetest person alive. She NEVER hurt me, she just prevented me from getting treatment because she lives in complete denial of anything threatening. She even pretends my sister isn't gay because she thinks she can will things away. I feel bad for her cause I wonder if it is MY fault she became this way. Maybe if she didn't have a psycho cunt daughter with OCD who told her she hated her everyday, she wouldn't have turned to denial so often. What if I made HER crazy, too? I feel like a curse, and my dad called me that a lot as a kid, he also called me a fat cunt, etc. He told me "he tried to motivate me."\u000a\u000aThat clearly didn't work for my depression, because I'm still here, alone on a Friday night, posting to Reddit for help that I probably won't get. People will probably skim this, say TLDR, and move on. Because I'm fucking worthless. And I know it. You guys don't actually care about me.\u000a\u000aI am here tonight because I feel like there is literally no hope for me. I have tried therapy, meds, etc. I am now 23 years old. I just graduated college. I made NO FRIENDS in college, because my OCD resurfaced in the form of a severe eating disorder. I lost 100 lbs and ended up 68 lbs at age 19. I almost died, and nobody at my school wanted to be seen with me because I was so disgusting and thin (the cruel irony when I grew up fat). Still, I got a 4.0 in college. I moved out at age 20 and got a job in a really cool place. I landed a near impossible job. I don't want to get into the specifics for confidentiality purposes, but I work at a studio as a filmmaker. \u000a\u000aWhen I tell people my life story, they judge me. Nobody ever looked at me the same after I made my college thesis film about having depression. I have several people in my alumni association telling everyone "she's crazy." It does more than hurt my feelings, it makes me want to fucking kill myself. I finally got this dream job, and here these assholes in the alumni association are, ruining my chance to start fresh and excel. I never hurt anyone. All I did was have a mental illness. And yet they want to ruin me. I don't feel like I can succeed at my new job now, since some of the alumni work at the same studio. If I am such a burden to my mom and dad, if I can't control my weight or eating now, why am I alive?

VI don't want to get too deep into the story because it'll take up several paragraphs.  Point is: I'm a grad student who did poorly in last semester's courses and got terrible reviews from the students I TAed to boot.  The director sent me a "strongly worded email" over the matter, although I'm nowhere close to fired/dismissed.  I think I've identified two major mistakes that I made that, fixed, will solve the problem I had, and I'm also going to discuss time management with my psychiatrist and therapist (I have ADHD).\u000a\u000aBut the incident still hit me hard emotionally.  I already have low self-confidence and feel like I'm a "worthless piece of crap" who "can't do anything right" and now I feel even more so.  Clearly I have had success in my life, but there's a voice in my brain that dismisses those things, highlights my failure, and tells me that I'm an "attention-seeking baby" who just needs to shape up and get over it.  Also, doom-and-gloom scenarios about how I'll never find anyone who wants to hire me because of my marks and how I'll never amount to anything and should just fucking die.\u000a\u000aI'm working and thus more active today, so I feel better.  But I had a really hard time getting out of bed the past few mornings and have had serious thoughts of suicide that included detailed mental images.  Suicide may not be the answer, but sometimes I'm not sure what else the answer might be.

I'm alone again, I've got no one, my friends don't know the story and have sided with her in the breakup over "mutual differences".\u000a\u000aI can't tell them the truth, it hurts too much, and I feel I need to die.

VI'm a student in England with bipolar type 1 disorder; I am on medication and in therapy, and I'm the most depressed I've ever been.\u000a\u000a I'm meant to be writing a 4,000 word essay which is due in for Tuesday, and I'm writing it, but my brain keeps skipping to reasons why and ways to kill myself. \u000a\u000a I'm writing about Shakespeare and I start thinking about walking down the road off the roundabout and waiting for a lorry to come along. Or walking to a canal and jumping, or climbing to the top of the library and jumping. I've already looked into overdosing on my medication and it seems nobody has ever succeeded with killing themselves, with the medication I'm on. \u000a\u000a I'm not sure if this is active suicidal ideation. I've not self harmed for a year and last time I tried to kill myself (overdose) there were no beds and I was sent home with some leaflets. I'm also diagnosed with borderline personality disorder so the doctors never take anything I say seriously. There is no point trying to talk to a medical professional. \u000a\u000a I need more time on the essay but that's just pathetic. I'm 150 miles away from my family and my boyfriend, I'm 650 overdrawn, I have a job interview (video one) I'm too anxious and messed up to do - and only two days in which to do it, I've got this deadline and then another 4,000 words to write in two weeks and then the rest of my dissertation for the end of April. \u000a\u000a I can't tell people how bad I feel because a) I don't want to burden them and b) they'd be better off without me anyway and c) they might make me see a doctor or take time off uni and if I want to graduate in the summer which I have to do or I'll never find a grad job, I can't take a break. \u000a\u000a I just want to not be around any more. I've never felt this low and never felt this alone and I can't see a way out.

VPlease just hear me out. How can any of us achieve any sort of stability if everything changes? The world around us changes, people change - how am I suppose to keep anyone I love in my life if we all change. I want the friends I had but my mom pointed out that I'm pinning for something that doesn't exist anymore. I had so much fun with them and now all I do is get drunk and do drugs - how can these things be it to feeling some sort of happiness? I'm on antidepressants but it doesn't seem to help. The one friend I still have says that this is just like a tide- it'll go away and I won't feel suicidal or depressed one moment but happy the next but for me it is always there. Happiness for me is the tidal wave, it is fickle and wavering- depression is constant for me. So what is the point if I will lose the precious friends I made? All that matters is the experiences I had with them and clinging to memories is worthless. I just want one thing to stay the same, but it's impossible, people you know will die or change or stop talking to you and even if you view yourself as the sum of all your relations, your relations will dwindle and change constantly. I don't understand what keeps me here. Some say "to feel" but these intense feelings hurt me more than anything. I just want things to be stable for more than a moment in my life

VI would like to know how normal it is to think of suicide, not using normal in a "Normal is good" sense, i mean , statistically speaking, i am very happy right now, but i have dealt with deppresion, with break ups, with people hurting you bad, just to win arguments, and i have thought about suicide, not only as a philosophical interest, but i have thought about killing myself, just because i can, i never would, but, when i was deppressed, i was afraid of standing on windows in buildings, becaus i was afraid i would jump, i knew i wouldnt jump, but i still thought of that, once i even said to myself, Ok, i know i am not going to jump so i will just stand over the edge and see what i feel, and if i try to jump i'll run inside, and nothing happened, i felt like i could do the jump, but i wouldnt do it, i just didnt think it was ok to kill myself. I am a bit of a nihilist, but i love people and life, i still think life may be meaningless, but i undesratnd the question itself is too complicated, we don't even know what "the meanign of life" means, i mean, if life had an objective purporse or meaning, i would get deppressed knowing my life just exists to fulfill one purpose, i really don't want to kill myself guys, i just want to talk about the subject, i think a lot of people think about suicide, but they are afraid to admit it, they don't want to accept it because they fear of not being normal, of people fearing them because they are the weird guy who thinks about killing himself... the most cheerful moment i remember from highschool, was that day we were talking about death in class, and someone said something about being curious about knowing what afterlife was like, i looked at a not so close friend and said, "i would kill myself just to know what's being death like" he smiled with an honest smile , like he was thinking the same thing and said " yeah, i really would like to kill myself for knowing that, i can't wait" we laughed.

VHi. I am 17 years old and have felt constantly afflicted with feelings of anger and depression for the past few years.\u000aI am unattractive and lacking any form of social skills, as well as having far below average intelligence; I am completely worthless as a person. I am incapable of keeping friends on the internet and in real life due to mood swings and my insufferable personality. I've felt like this for a very long time now and my dad died earlier this week. The entirety of this week I've felt like killing myself and earlier I tried to tie a rope around my shower but the knot wasn't tight enough, I feel trapped, helpless and I really just want to be happy.\u000aI haven't tried going to a psychiatrist (or don't even know the process) and I want to admit myself to a hospital so I don't kill myself. However, I do not know the process of either of these so I would be very happy if someone could inform me. Thank you. I live in the United Kingdom.

I'll just go and jump. I'll end my life quietly, without anyone knowing. I have Celiac disease, I have gluten intolerance. I have washroom problems everyday, I'm constipated on a daily basis. I have trouble with everything in my life because of Celiac and because of ADHD and IBS. Nobody cares, not even my fucking gastroenterologist who diagnosed me. I don't have enough money to afford a fucking gluten free diet every fucking month. It's better to just jump off a bridge, end my stupid shit life full of problems, and end my fucking miserable existence.\u000a\u000aI tried to kill myself twice before and I ended up in the mental hospital on both occasions. But third times the charm, the third time there won't be a hospital for me. There will only be the fires of hell waiting for me, because God don't like quitters and God don't like ugly.

Spent the next 6 weeks preparing for community college and did a week of that till I quit followed by  a suicide attempt. Spent the next 7 weeks doing nothing until just recently. Ive applied for jobs and the interviews have been going horrible because im a very shy, introverted, awkward person. Every time I quit or fail at something, I take a blow to the little confidence i have and it makes it that much harder to pick myself up and put myself back out there. I just want to give up. I feel like i dont belong anywhere. Every thing that I do or try to do is just so I can tell my family that im doing something so I don't look like a pathetic deadbeat. My girlfriend says my place in this world is with her but I feel like it isnt enough. I should be contributing but everytime i try, I freak out and get suicidal and quit. I just dont have a place in this society and on this planet and I want to give up because that is the only way I'll be able to find peace.

VHello all, I should probably just clarify up front that I do not intend to  die on this trip, but a lot of what I talk about has to do with my suiciadal thoughts and depression. \u000a\u000a\u000aSo I'm a 20 year old college sophomore who has been more or less depressed for 5-6 years. Last October I had a suicide attempt where my roommate found me, leading to me being admitted and then more or less forced in to therapy/prozac. I won't lie the prozac helped for a while, but I'd be lying if I said I don't wake up daily hating my life. Everything about college makes me miserable. Oh be sure you're joining 20 clubs, getting straight A's, getting a good internship for this summer etc etc. I just want to walk away from it all. \u000a\u000a\u000aWhich brings me to part two and the main focus of my title. For several years I've been obsessed with Chris McCandless's story(on which the movie Into the Wild is based). For as long as I can remember being alone in nature has been one of the only times I can say I was truly happy. Hiking for a long time was my outlet but now that I don't have a car I don't get to go out in the mountains except maybe once every 4-5 months. I've also had a long standing dream of going West and seeing the National Parks from a lot of reading I've done on John Muir. And so I began making this plan.\u000a\u000a\u000aAt the end of this academic year in June I would simply like to put all my things in storage, carry with me only what I need, walk out to the nearest freeway and start hitch hiking West. I do not want anyone to know about this, especially my parents. It's not that I don't want them to know I'm safe, but that I know they would never allow me to do something like this by saying shit like "that's too dangerous" "you'll get murdered by some lunatic" or "you can travel when you're older". Well I'm done waiting and frankly if I have to keep enduring this miserable lifestyle I will off myself before I get the chance to do anything like this that I love. \u000a\u000a\u000aSo now I need help planning and preparing for this undertaking. I have about 4000 dollars in savings that I intend to take out in cash to help me buy the essentials and help me along the way(and to ensure I'm not tracked using my debit card). So far I've purchased maps and begun looking into lightweight tents that I could carry on foot as well as a hiking back pack big enough to carry everything I need.\u000a\u000a\u000aIf anyone has any suggestions on things I definitely need to bring please tell me and give me any feedback you can. Thank you all so much for reading.

VI got in from college and I didn't feel great so I just went into my room and watched YouTube videos to distract myself. My mum ignores me for 2 hours then asks me 'why am I sulking?' I say I'm not and that' I just didn't want to go downstairs'. So after a little while I go into her room reluctantly and tell her how I'm feeling. I am struggling to cope with depression really bad now, I just hide it to everyone. She says I have to figure out how to deal with it. When I mention I have thought about suicide, she tells me to get my shoes on and 'get one with it'. So I do, I go straight out the house and walk to the main road. I phoned childline, as my counsellor told me to if I got into a situation like this. The lady on the phone calmed me down and persuaded me to go back home, so I do. When I get home, my mum bursts into my room screaming for me to get out the house. She shoves me out my room and as I start going down the stairs, she shoved me again and I fell right to the bottom. Smacked my head into wall a few times and have bruised all my sides up. She dragged me out the house and bolted the door, with me in nothing but socks. Now I'm done with trying for good this time. The sooner I get the rest of my pills, the better.

VI can't take it anymore. My anxiety is suffocating me. I hate every waking moment of my existent with my diseased fucked up brain that relentlessly tortures me. I am 21 in college and I am currently at my parents house for the weekend. It sort of sucks that I am here, because at school there are a lot of parking decks that I could jump off of. I really want to jump off this 7 story parking garage that is a sort walk from where I live off campus. I don't know how to control my thoughts and I can't do it one more day. I write notes obsessively because I don't know how to control my thoughts. I have talked to 2 different therapists and no help was had. I am so fucking sick of this shitty existence, I am a failure to everyone and everything.

VI knew my girlfriend for over 8 years, since kindergarten. She was fucking perfect. We started dating about 2 years ago and my life was finally in order and about 2 weeks ago she broke up with me because she wanted to be alone and wasn't happy with herself. We were both sad and clearly still loved each other and the idea of getting back together was in the air. We still talked, but after a few days the responses became dry texts like "yeah" and "okay" and then just no response. She started avoiding me at classes and the route we walk together she walked with my friend instead. About 4 months ago, this "friend" apparently said "I'm just waiting for ___ and ___ to break up so I can fuck her" and I didn't want to believe it (found out from a reliable source and best friend) and today at work, he came in. And she stopped working and just talked to him and talked and we closed and he left and he just waited outside and when we got off is instead of going to her car she went right to him, who was sitting in the back of his truck. I left before I saw anymore and I am fucking heartbroken. I honestly have lost my happiness and my will to continue is slowly dwindling. Not exactly suicidal, not yet at least. But I just can't take it. Fuck.

I always end up doing things I regret in retrospect. \u000aAny advice on the way I can talk myself through it?\u000aI always try to tell myself you'll be happier in the future one day if you don't do this. But sometimes it's just really hard to think that way.\u000aI'm asking you guys because you guys also share this burden with me so any advice on the situation because with my current life and in accordance with how I act everytime it happens I'm sure one day I'll be in that mind State again. When I can't seem to focus on the future, everything just seems so much easier to end it.\u000aAnything helps from psychological aspects to personal experience help. this is all appreciated advice.\u000aThanks to anybody who replies or has any useful advice.

VHi all. I'm sure this is a pretty common post. But my girlfriend of 3 years just decided that we need a break for an undetermined amount of time and she can't even tell me of she's going to be seeing/ sleeping with anyone during that time. We've been through an insane amount together given how young we are; i helped her get through her self harm/ depression, i was willing to commit to a long-distance relationship when she moved away and stayed faithful even when she couldn't, i put up with that (call it strength or cowardice ive heard it both ways) and Hell when i found out she was being raped in her home my family gave her a place to stay. I feel like I must be truly broken to be able to do so much for someone and have them still not be happy with me. She says that she needs time to figure herself out and that she wants to do it on her own but I've always offered time and space if she needs it. She admits that she's being selfish and says that she just doesn't want to beb\u000a responsible for a relationship right now (go figure... Stick around until you're no longer depressed and decide it's too much to handle when I am). We still have been kind of talking as friends but she just seems to get mad or irritated when i ask about what's going on with us, always just saying "i dont know ok?".\u000a\u000aI've given everything i have to this relationship and i don't think i really have much left to offer the world. I grew so accustomed to us living together and doing everything as a team that i don't even know what single life is like anymore. The worst part is that while i sit at home staring out the window to see if she comes back she's probably out partying with her friends enjoying her new carefree life. \u000a\u000aAnyways I'll cut to the chase. I want to give this break a chance. But if it doesn't work out i don't really think i want to be around anymore. My family is mostly disappointed in me because I'm not taking as many classes as i should (1st year at a community college) or because I'm a socially awkward computer nerd with no friends. Obviously they'd be upset and miss me but i don't really think anyone in my family is cherishing my existence. The only friends i have are her and my other best friend from high school whom I've been treating like shit (never asking to hang out etc). He'd be devastated I'm sure because I'm one of his only friends too but he's more sociable than i am and would move one well enough. Probably pretty well since i haven't really been around all that much. I know that she would be devastated as well and would probably blame herself but she gets free therapy from the state and she has all of her friends to support her. She's also not unattractive at all and I'm sure she'd find someone to replace me within a few months anyways. \u000a\u000aI'm going to give it time but i think that if things don't work out I'm going to find some cheesy poetic way to off myself either on my birthday or our anniversary, both in December. The only thing that would be effected for others would be Christmas, none of my friends or family have birthdays after those dates so I'm sure it wouldn't be too hard for everyone. \u000a\u000aI don't want to die. That's why i posted here. But i don't want to live in this shit world alone either. It took me so long to be this comfortable with someone and to truly fall in love and due to both lack of ability and lack of desire i know it's never going to happen again. If i can't have her i can't have anyone, and if i can't have anyone i really don't want myself.

He's became more morose after getting that news, he had a heart to heart with me about how he's thinking of doing it. He seemed distant even talking about how he wants to do it. Like distant from emotions surrounding ending it. I'm close with the family and his dad is worried too. He does see a counselor. I don't know what do to. Should he get an mri all over his back?

VI'm trying to help my mom.. she is so hurt inside over the pain I've caused ripping apart this family. She reflects that pain back into me at the slightest change in my movements across life and I have just been hurt so badly by her words I don't know what to do... it just makes my stomach churn not being able to think my way though this. I can't even eat anymore.. I feel weak inside mentally but I can't sleep either.. I just feel stuck in these thoughts I wish I had some clarity but the lord has already tried showing me a path of which I can not find anymore for I have lost my body in this darkness I sincerely wish I could have the light back in this cave I've wondered into with the sleeping bear\u000aI feel like life doesn't end, we pass through infinities every day, giving away each passing moment to change our thoughts and prayers. I feel like when we die death never comes it just approaches closer and closer whilst never reaching us as we are conscious beings. In that sense I sincerely hope and have faith that god is true and will take my soul from my body into his arms without damning me to an internal hell trapped within my own body for these infinities we wade through so care free... I pray I will see light on this path I've made. I welcome death but fear it will never come. Not for thinking I am immortal no , but for thinking of infinity. For something without end would be the scariest thing to me. I'm just here ranting my internal thoughts trying to make connections with beings that may or may not exist. I'm not even sure if I exist. I cast doubt over my own thoughts and influence and am still paying the price for the harm I've brought here to this pure place. I sometimes condone my own existence feeling like I have fucked over everyone who has come across me in life since the day I was brought into it. My memories are faded now and all I can remember are the negative things I've heard from the people I can't forget. I don't know what love is but I hope I can find the empathy again just for a sliver of hope in this strange game we've constructed for ourselves. I feel lost in my own labyrinth and the beast is lurking behind every shadow. It's so hard to stay clean now that I have a grasp on my own construction of reality I want it to fade away again into the nothing so I will feel blissful in my ignorance of all that is to come to me. I'm struggling to gain thought on how to process it all. I doubt I'm making any sense to anyone here. I've been damned and my clarity has been stolen from me again, no, taken, I've been blinded for my punishment and thrown back into the maze without eyes. I need a hand to hold and to guide me back up to the surface... I can't help but to speak in metaphors now... my story is too complex to try to explain otherwise. These metaphors help me get across how I feel but I don't feel like anyone understands them anymore. It's nice to just type away the time here as the morning comes. I wish I could remember my dreams for once maybe then I would learn from these mistakes I've made.

VI want to die a lot tonight. Yesterday. the day before that. the days before that.\u000ai was in the hospital for 2 weeks a few months ago for suicide stuff and i've been trying to play it off like i'm okay now but i am not. not even close. especially when trying to decide what to do with my life and make plans for that even though i don't want to be alive. People are expecting me to plan my life and i don't want to let them know how  very bad the suicide stuff is again so i keep trying and trying hoping something will change but it doesn't. I even have to force myself to hang out with people i love because i let them all go six months ago and found SO MUCH PEACE then it all went to shit and i'm still here. I will say that i'm endlessly grateful for my life. i'm just fucking tired. and confused and like i'm taking from a world i only want to give back to. i can't tell anyone how bad it is because who the fuck wants to hear that? no one. truth. they want me to be "all better" so they can sleep better at night. so i'm gonna let them keep thinking i'm alright like i have done since the 8th grade. over achieve, socialize, reach out,  go to counseling while secretly feeling totally dead inside except for a select few feelings and an overwhelming exhaustion i can't shake. honestly counseling is the ONLY  thing i look forward to. and it's an hour once a week. i can't put in words the way all this is jumbled and stuff in my head and i don't know why this happens or why the tiredness and pain never go away. i don't know why i always feel dirty and overwhelmed and like i just want to hand someone my heart so they could understand. actually i wish i fucking understood this shit because i don't. i just don't know and i'm so confused and i just want to be at peace again. not a pain free life but one where my mind isn't broken this way so often and i just wish i knew how to rest properly. rambling because i REALLY REALLY want to hurt myself right now SO BADLY but the mess just gets harder and harder to clean up the worse it gets. anyway, goodnight \U0001f499

"Hey, sorry about that. I know you weren't expecting to go that way. But you, know... divine plan." He proceeds to tell them that he will grant each of them one request. Anything they want. The first woman in line thinks, and says "Make me beautiful!" And so he does. The man behind her says, "Make me handsome!" And so he does. One by one, they all realize their chance to be beautiful forever, and they all wish for the same thing. God comes to the last man in line, who is laughing uncontrollably. When asked what he wants, he says, "Make them all ugly again!"

Therefore, as my best and most trusted friend, I am\u000aleaving you the key to her chastity belt to use should I not return from the Crusade."\u000a\u000aThe company of knights were only a mile or so out of town when they noticed a cloud of dust approaching.\u000aThinking it might be an important message from the town the column halted.\u000a\u000aA horseman approached.

VA man gets on a bus, and ends up sitting next to a very attractive nun. Enamored with her, he asks if he can have sex with her. Naturally, she says no, and gets off the bus. The man goes to the bus driver and asks him if he knows of a way for him to have sex with the nun. "Well," says the bus driver, "every night at 8 o'clock, she goes to the cemetery to pray. If you dress up as God, I'm sure you could convince her to have sex with you." The man decides to try it, and dresses up in his best God costume. At eight, he sees the nun and appears before her. "Oh, God!" she exclaims. "Take me with you!" The man tells the nun that she must first have sex with him to prove her loyalty. The nun says yes, but tells him she prefers anal sex. Before you know it, they're getting down to it, having nasty, grunty, loud sex. After it's over, the man pulls off his God disguise. "Ha, ha! I'm the man from the bus!" "Ha, ha!" says the nun, removing her costume. "I'm the bus driver!"
