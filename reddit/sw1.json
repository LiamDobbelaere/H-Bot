I'm empty. I have sever ADD and have been zoning out my whole life. Socially I have always been passive and some times opinionated. As a child I had few friends and went through periods with none. This wasn't because kids excluded me, people often try to talk to me but there is nothing here to share.\n\n I don't feel I ever developed and identity. I haven't been present enough to create experiences with any depth. When any thing is difficult my mind withdraws and zones out i keep trying to bring it back but life doesnt have any continuity sliping in and out of consciousness. As a result all I've learned in life is in bits and peices. \n\n I also know I'm depressed i have been anxious and depressed since 3rd grade I'm 20 now. I also know what it would take to change. Sometimes i have bursts of optomism and imagine the ideal journey of recover I'll undergo and the life I'll create. It's a dellusion though. All the qualities it would take to change I've never developed; perseverance, metacognition, self awarness, self motivation, comunication, self expression.\n\n I know what it would take to change I've been going to therapy for 6 months and have been reading about ADD. I've been trying to follow a schedule I meditate, eat healthy and lightly excercise but it all seems so pointless alone. It's also not that much and I don't think I'm capable of maintaining a job or frienship, I struggle to even communicate with my therapist. Sometimes I think I make up problems and act emotional in therapy because I don't really know what I think in the moment.\n\n I'm going to try stimulant medication for the first time in a week. I've tried ssri's one worked for the depressiona for 4 years but exacerbated the ADD and made be even less self aware. I had fun and friends but I was making a complete ass of myself and going no where. Ive tried ADD non stims strattera made me more depressed and I'm on intuniv it isn't doing much for me.

I came to the conclusion that I either would kill myself on the spot or make a significant effort to improve my life. At the time I chose the latter and I think I regret it now.\n\nWhat's so sad is I feel like I was making significant progress in improving myself to the point where I could maybe become a normal human being in the near future. I started Uni with a really good GPA and wanted to go to grad school. I was even thinking I might be almost good enough to try and get a girlfriend at one point. My friend even think I'm gay because I've never had a girlfriend. Like I said, I'm pathetic.\n\nI just had to fuck it all up.\n\nI barely ever talked to my parents for most of my life so I figured I would just finish university and move out peacefully without causing any issues. Nope, I'm now reminded why I'm a complete failure at everything I do.\n\nI just had a small disagreement with my father a couple of hours ago and I FUCKED it up. I usually just avoid conflicts and try to not argue with him but whatever, it started to get a little heated so I told him that he has issues (I'm convinced he's really does have issues). He started slamming doors and yelled at me. I then told him how I really felt about him. I told him that I didn't love him and that I never wanted to have to see him again. fuck fuck fuck\n\nI know my sister/mom don't really love him either. The dispute with my father ended with him telling me he has no place on this planet and wants to kill himself. I know he's been suicidal in the past but god dammit. I don't love him but I fell like I just put the last straw that broke the camel's back. If he kills himself it's my god damn fault. If I never said anything everything would have been fine. I don't even know if I care if he dies or not to be honest. I don't think I have any options left. I can't become a normal human being. I'm so useless.\n\nWhat in the world is wrong with me? Why did I have to say anything? I should have just killed myself a long time ago.\n\nWhy am I even posting here.\n\nFUCK\n", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "5xqqwk", "gilded": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "score": 19, "report_reasons": null, "author": "whatever5233", "saved": false, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t3_5xqqwk", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SuicideWatch", "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "domain": "self.SuicideWatch", "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qpzs", "edited": 1488768029.0, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": "modmsg", "downs": 0, "brand_safe": false, "archived": false, "removal_reason": null, "is_self": true, "hide_score": false, "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/5xqqwk/why_didnt_i_shut_the_fuck_up/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1488796184.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/5xqqwk/why_didnt_i_shut_the_fuck_up/", "author_flair_text": "", "quarantine": false, "title": "Why didn't I shut the fuck up?", "created_utc": 1488767384.0, "distinguished": null, "media": null, "num_comments": 15, "visited": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 19}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"contest_mode": false, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "selftext_html": "\u003C!-- SC_OFF --\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\"md\"\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShe cheated on me 10 months ago. 6 weeks before our wedding.

This is worse, much worse. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI pretty much gave up, except for making the step to see the psychologist on campus two weeks ago. I had thoughts of suicide before and called the suicide hotline late at night when I was walking down the streets, super homeless. The homeless part? Left my keys at parents\u0026#39; home and survived 2 weeks without going into my dorm. Really bad time, I\u0026#39;m walking down the street because I can\u0026#39;t sleep and was thinking of suicide. So I had someone physically meet me at 2 in the morning, in the middle of some street on campus. Police was there too, because duh, it\u0026#39;s 2 am and maybe I\u0026#39;m a violent person. Far enough. So they made me sign papers, agreement to see a psychologist on campus at a certain time or they get involved.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay, so I started to see my psychologist. Now I have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder. The sessions don\u0026#39;t help because I just talk to him for an hour, but there\u0026#39;s so much of a mess in my life that I don\u0026#39;t share all the details. He gleams over the particular things that causes me stress, focusing only on the past. Dude, I need to change the present and future, forget about my shitty childhood.

I decided Publix because the Aspirin--my drug of choice, has a prettier looking bottle.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ESo when I got there, I grabbed my bottle of Aspirin and a bottle of ICE to make it go down easier. Then, freezing in the cold, I sat on the bench outside and started to pop the pills, watching the people go to their cars. I counted the pills and read the label thoroughly.  1st pill, drink. 2nd pill, drink. I remembered from a class that Aspirin has a high LD50 for a low dosage compared to other drugs. At that moment, that was when I decided if I were to suicide, it would be Aspirin. Two years prior, I made that choice to use that drug as my partner in crime. 3rd pill, drink. 4th pill, drink. Only x more pills to go to die from a bleeding stomach and a shot liver and kidney. 5th pill, drink. I down the 5th pill and think, I\u0026#39;m 1/3 of the way done.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI was going to down my 6th pill, so I put it in my palm. And I dropped the pill. I just couldn\u0026#39;t do it. I\u0026#39;m a coward for not completing my mission, perhaps, but at that moment, I realized that I really don\u0026#39;t want to die. I just want my problems to disappear, running away from my problems.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EInstead of going to class, eating food, and keeping up with friends: I just stayed in bed and slept. And slept. And slept. I also was recently dumped and the guy was my first? So the bed became more enticing. My roommate hates me. Sleep and sleep. My roommate brings guests over while I\u0026#39;m sleeping and has alcohol? I get drunk and sleep and sleep. My friends don\u0026#39;t want to see me again? Sleep and sleep.

Stopped going to class for weeks and sealed my fate when I decided to not go for my midterms. I skipped. I just couldn't do it. There's a lot of zeros but that was my choice: to not save myself. Can't trust myself to do the right thing. Professors been emailing me to drop the classes. \n\n\nI am already on academic probation from last semester. The same scenario playing out, depression winning the game--except I failed one class and barely passed the other in the last semester. Now I'm failing them all. This is worse, much worse. \n\n\nI pretty much gave up, except for making the step to see the psychologist on campus two weeks ago. I had thoughts of suicide before and called the suicide hotline late at night when I was walking down the streets, super homeless. The homeless part? Left my keys at parents' home and survived 2 weeks without going into my dorm. Really bad time, I'm walking down the street because I can't sleep and was thinking of suicide. So I had someone physically meet me at 2 in the morning, in the middle of some street on campus. Police was there too, because duh, it's 2 am and maybe I'm a violent person. Far enough. So they made me sign papers, agreement to see a psychologist on campus at a certain time or they get involved.\n\n\nOkay, so I started to see my psychologist. Now I have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder. The sessions don't help because I just talk to him for an hour, but there's so much of a mess in my life that I don't share all the details. He gleams over the particular things that causes me stress, focusing only on the past. Dude, I need to change the present and future, forget about my shitty childhood. I'm at wits end, and decided to take my life. \n\n\nThis was just the last straw.\n\n\nI wouldn't show my mom the grades so I walked out with my purse and left in a short dress in the middle of the cold night. And I walked for 20 minutes, deciding whether to hit CVS or Publix. I decided Publix because the Aspirin--my drug of choice, has a prettier looking bottle.\n\nSo when I got there, I grabbed my bottle of Aspirin and a bottle of ICE to make it go down easier. Then, freezing in the cold, I sat on the bench outside and started to pop the pills, watching the people go to their cars. I counted the pills and read the label thoroughly.  1st pill, drink. 2nd pill, drink. I remembered from a class that Aspirin has a high LD50 for a low dosage compared to other drugs. At that moment, that was when I decided if I were to suicide, it would be Aspirin. Two years prior, I made that choice to use that drug as my partner in crime. 3rd pill, drink. 4th pill, drink. Only x more pills to go to die from a bleeding stomach and a shot liver and kidney. 5th pill, drink. I down the 5th pill and think, I'm 1/3 of the way done.\n\n\nI was going to down my 6th pill, so I put it in my palm. And I dropped the pill. I just couldn't do it. I'm a coward for not completing my mission, perhaps, but at that moment, I realized that I really don't want to die. I just want my problems to disappear, running away from my problems.\n\n\nInstead of going to class, eating food, and keeping up with friends: I just stayed in bed and slept. And slept. And slept. I also was recently dumped and the guy was my first? So the bed became more enticing. My roommate hates me. Sleep and sleep. My roommate brings guests over while I'm sleeping and has alcohol? I get drunk and sleep and sleep. My friends don't want to see me again? Sleep and sleep. My Dad asking me for my agenda? Sleep and sleep.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow I have to tell my mother the truth. Tomorrow, the whole thing.
