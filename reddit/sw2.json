Fancy meeting you here.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI think... I think it is time for me to go. I\u0026#39;m a 19 year old, who all his life has waited to get out of his abusive parents house, and now that I am out... I feel... disenchanted with the world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn high school I was a prodigy. I was smart, 34 on my ACT, track and cross country team captain. I played the violin pretty well too, good grades, everything was great. I worked really hard to be the goody goody and do everything perfectly to one day get the hell away from home.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EHere I am, a year after leaving. I got a minor in consumption a month ago, and just got a speeding ticket for going 103 in a 75. I drink regularly, I had a girlfriend who was morbidly depressed and a drug addict--I have since left her--I\u0026#39;m on a cross country team and nobody likes me. I am half the man I used to be. I just have become a piece of shit overall. Average. Below average. Worthless.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0026#39;s more, I have reached a point where I don\u0026#39;t even really care about what other people think. Nobody is really close to me anymore. I am pretty much alone. I have some friends, but nobody close enough that they wouldn\u0026#39;t be able to get over me.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI guess I just...

I feel... disenchanted with the world.\n\nIn high school I was a prodigy. I was smart, 34 on my ACT, track and cross country team captain. I played the violin pretty well too, good grades, everything was great. I worked really hard to be the goody goody and do everything perfectly to one day get the hell away from home.\n\nHere I am, a year after leaving. I got a minor in consumption a month ago, and just got a speeding ticket for going 103 in a 75. I drink regularly, I had a girlfriend who was morbidly depressed and a drug addict--I have since left her--I'm on a cross country team and nobody likes me. I am half the man I used to be. I just have become a piece of shit overall. Average. Below average. Worthless.\n\nWhat's more, I have reached a point where I don't even really care about what other people think. Nobody is really close to me anymore. I am pretty much alone. I have some friends, but nobody close enough that they wouldn't be able to get over me.\n\nI guess I just...

This is much worse than I am acknowledging to my own self right now. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor my entire life I have been severely bullied (first time I\u0026#39;m ever acknowledging this properly), and it all started with my family. I was the scapegoat, and imprisoned, tortured, brainwashed, and controlled are the words that come to mind when I think about what I survived. Last year I finally escaped and I haven\u0026#39;t looked back; I went completely no contact with my narc/sociopathic family. I\u0026#39;ve had a year of psychotherapy with the most incredible psychologist who I deeply trust. Unfortunately this has been so expensive and I don\u0026#39;t have a lot of savings, so I can no longer afford to see him. I need therapy though, and medication most likely, which I have avoided until now. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI have absolutely no family support. I have no relatives I could reach out to either. So I\u0026#39;m alone and I feel very vulnerable. The few good friends I have live far away but I do reach out to them online a bit. As for friends in real life, I do not trust anyone at the moment. I struggle to bond with people because I do not easily trust people and I am extremely guarded. I have attracted the wrong kind, so I feel I need space to heal and build my confidence and trust again.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI was never exposed to the real world. I\u0026#39;m only now learning of its true horrors. For an idealist who dreams of world peace, it is absolutely terrifying to me, and I feel such deep despair and sadness about all the cruelty I am witnessing and experiencing myself. How can it be that the world is this cold and brutal? I see moments of beauty, but it feels like nothing compared to the awfulness that\u0026#39;s out there. I know I need to accept the reality of life, I need to accept that things are just this way. I don\u0026#39;t know how to. I don\u0026#39;t want to.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe main cause of these feelings is work. I have been suffering for 1.5 years at this company. I\u0026#39;m stuck there right now because I can\u0026#39;t afford to be unemployed and I\u0026#39;m too anxious/depressed//scared/weak to pass these interviews, even though I always get them when I apply. I am such an easy target in the workplace. I haven\u0026#39;t yet learned how to blend in and I refuse to \u0026#39;play the game\u0026#39;, but sometimes it feels necessary. I refuse to sacrifice my integrity, but I also need to stand up for myself more. Bullies love me. I am always kind, nice, helpful, I am also competent and smart, I don\u0026#39;t have bad looks, and I am \u0026#39;different\u0026#39; (super introverted, individualistic, in my own world at times, can appear weird to certain types). Working in an all female environment, with a few sociopaths thrown in, has meant that from day one I was their target. From day one they ate me alive and they\u0026#39;re still chewing me up. I have cried myself to sleep and felt so hurt and disappointed for so long now. Not only at them for doing it to me, in fact it\u0026#39;s more that they have to be this way at all.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThere has been some relief. My current manager saw me struggling, she\u0026#39;s one of the only decent people there, and moved me onto her team, but it\u0026#39;s still in the same department. Only thing now is a couple of my new coworkers are very sinister and evil, and have been poisoned by my old coworkers. One of them, I called her out, and she has stopped her bullying now. The other... :( ... I\u0026#39;m so manipulated by him. He is twisted and sick in the head. I have to call him out but I\u0026#39;m scared! I was going to last night, but instead he fucked me over. I went out with him and a few others. He gave me a pill and I was really drunk. Him and his sociopathic friend really fucked with me when I was out of it. Seriously fucked with me, but I can\u0026#39;t exactly tell you how, you know? A lot of it was their energy, I could feel them both feeding off of my confusion/suffering, being emotional vampires.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI left, ran the fuck away to get home, told them I was sick. He knows I know what he\u0026#39;s doing, and he knows I\u0026#39;m too weak to stand up for myself right now. He is loving it. He intimidates me at work to the point where I cannot really be myself. What the fuck do I do!? I can\u0026#39;t tell management because that place is pathologically organized and they encourage competition and bullying. Do I confront him and say listen I know what you\u0026#39;re doing and I\u0026#39;m asking you to stop? I tried before and he denied it and makes out he loves me and all this shit, only to still bitch about me and subtly fuck with me time and time again. He has made friends with my other sociopathic colleagues who still want to fuck with me (just not as much), and no doubt has told them what I trusted him with. WHAT DO I DO!? Do I keep on fighting back? I know what the alternative is like, and that\u0026#39;s suffering in silence. I have to try a new approach. The new employee who took my old job is being bullied badly by them as well. Yesterday I sat with them and he said to me \u0026quot;Did they bully you as much as they\u0026#39;re bullying me!? Is that why you moved? Can we switch places!?\u0026quot; He said that in front of them!! I was shocked... One of them said, \u0026quot;That\u0026#39;s a sore subject we don\u0026#39;t talk about...\u0026quot; and I said \u0026quot;Resilience. Strength. You must and will learn these things from this team. It\u0026#39;s also a heavy topic to talk about on a Friday afternoon so let\u0026#39;s leave it alone.\u0026quot; Why do you think he did that!? I think it wasn\u0026#39;t his place to air my business like that publicly, but maybe he was trying to get some support from me? What do you think? I know he likes me and cares about me, but he\u0026#39;s very heavily manipulated/controlled by them so now I don\u0026#39;t talk to him much. I\u0026#39;m thinking to talk to him on Monday about it - wondering if that\u0026#39;s a good idea...?\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt was so bad last night that I asked strangers for help, and two guys took me home and really helped me. It was absolutely amazing of them, they saved me...but I invited them into my home! I just trusted them into my home, you know!? I feel so vulnerable for that, but I needed the support. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso I\u0026#39;m even more fragile right now because a couple days ago I broke things off with a sociopath I was seeing... I can\u0026#39;t believe it, no matter how many times I think I\u0026#39;ve learned, I\u0026#39;m still vulnerable to these types of people. I naively thought he was a genuinely kind guy, you know, everything I could have wanted, it was fantastic. Then I went on vacation with him and then he showed me his real face... :(... He kept picking on me, and he even said to me walking home late on the empty foreign streets, \u0026quot;What if I was a psychopath and just used chloroform on you right now...?\u0026quot; I said \u0026quot;Why would you say that!? You\u0026#39;re scaring me.\u0026quot; and he said \u0026quot;Shut the fuck up, of course I\u0026#39;d never hurt you! How the fuck could you question me? How could you think this... I doubt I can forgive you for this, etc.\u0026quot; :(... I foolishly let him back into my room that night, and I broke down crying, with images of old abusive ex-boyfriends flashing in my mind, huge alarm bells ringing. He whispered \u0026quot;I\u0026#39;m so sorry\u0026quot; into my ear and held me, and in that moment I could have died. His eyes were dead and cold, and I knew I had been duped again. AGAIN. Again.. It is just so painful to know I opened up to another one of these parasitic scumbags. I know these people are calculated and very clever, but I\u0026#39;m kicking myself because I just should have known. :( I\u0026#39;m proud that I at least called him out. On the flight home, I said \u0026quot;You\u0026#39;re a bully. A BULLY. Does it make you feel like a big man to pick on vulnerable girls like me?\u0026quot; He said, \u0026quot;Yeah, I feel like a big man, probably to make my dick feel bigger.\u0026quot; I said \u0026quot;Probably.\u0026quot; (I didn\u0026#39;t have sex with him so that\u0026#39;s a relief, and probably he hates women because of that very reason...) He also said, \u0026quot;You know bullies like me don\u0026#39;t like being called out on their shit\u0026quot;, and I said, \u0026quot;Well I just did. I\u0026#39;m not afraid of people like you. I know how you work, I\u0026#39;m not a fucking idiot, think you can emotionally manipulate me and give me shitty eye contact to try to fucking intimidate me!\u0026quot; He didn\u0026#39;t like that, was visibly angry. I was so proud of myself in that moment!! I felt so empowered and strong!! \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnyway... back to being alone again. I cannot trust anyone right now.

I'm so scared to lose my job, scared I'll end up homeless or a drug addict, scared to have no money, scared of being stuck forever, scared to stay in this job or find a new one where I may have more of the same, scared of everyone and everything. Scared of my state of mind.

Life is pretty shitty now but what makes it even worse is that it\u0026#39;s always been bad one way or another. I\u0026#39;ve had problems with anxiety and later depression for as long as I can remember. Through time it\u0026#39;s manifested under different forms; first by skipping school (which I still do, more on that later), then by cutting and now I eat too much and throw up. So it\u0026#39;s really always been hard and terrible just to be alive but I still want to go back because I don\u0026#39;t know how to move forward.

It\u0026#39;s like a shitty metaphor. Even if I stop being crazy around food and never throw up again a day in my life and completely get better physically my teeth are never going to \u0026#39;get better\u0026#39; with me. They\u0026#39;re always going to be there to remind of what a stupid worthless fuckup I am. So why stop purging? Why get better? Why not just keeping binging and purging until it kills me? As it is I don\u0026#39;t like to smile or talk in a way that shows my teeth because I don\u0026#39;t want anyone to see them.

Everything comes back to money, but that\u0026#39;s nothing new. Sometimes I think having perfect teeth would fix everything because at least then I could laugh and smile and not feel so ugly but I know that\u0026#39;s probably not true because there\u0026#39;s always something else, isn\u0026#39;t there?
