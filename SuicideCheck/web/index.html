        <h2>Details</h2>
        <p>There are several weaknesses in this trained model that make it unreliable.</p>
        <p>I used 200 posts from reddit's /r/SuicideWatch and 200 posts from /r/Jokes. Everything from SuicideWatch was labelled as suicidal (1) while all the Jokes posts were labelled as non suicidal (0).</p>
        <p>The amount of data should be way higher, and the nature of the data is too unvaried. It's all from reddit and the non suicidal examples only consist of jokes.</p>
        <p>The model was first experimented with in Weka, then recreated in Java using Weka's Java libraries. The Multilayer Perceptron classifier came out with some of the best results and 97% accuracy, however my original intention was to use a Naive Bayes classifier.</p>
        <p>Take the accuracy with a big grain of salt, because it was tested on the training data. It's normally recommended to have a completely separate dataset dedicated for testing only.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, the results are pretty good although not perfect.</p>
        <p>Also take note that what you think might be an example of a suicidal person's statement, might not be something they would actually say in reality and may come out as non-suicidal. The model, although limited, is trained on real examples.</p>
